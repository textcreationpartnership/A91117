            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THe present dispensation upon the world is darke and gloomy, as also so mysterious to many of the Saints, as (according to <hi>Zach. 14.6.</hi>) Is neither dark nor cleare; In which season the mystery of iniquity (the spirit of the Beast and false Prophet) doth transforme himself into an Angel of light, and is working by the <hi>Protector</hi> (so called) many of the Rulers, and Clergy of the Nation, and weaves the designe he would carry on with so fine a web, so much pretending for Christ, the good of Saints, and the Nation (when it is not so) as that none but the Lord can discover him, which he is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as also destroying him by the Spirit of his mouth and brightnes of his comming.</p>
            <p>And because that things are so that many of the Saints who desire to be faithfull to, more refined in, and cannot (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord leave them) Apostatize from, their former Ʋir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Spirit, and principle, which they had for him, his worke and people (and in which he hath so owned them) are persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, imprisoned, and most barbarously used, by the above Mentioned <hi>Protector</hi> and his brethren (the Apostates, and backsliders of our day, and Nation) and their Mercenary soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for bearing their testimonies, against the horrid wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes, and abominations which are broken in upon us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to those promises, engagements, protestations, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which he and the Army made to the Lord, and his people in the day of our streights, which actions (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) can proceede from no other then the Mystery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which at present workes, <hi>2 Thes. 2.9.10.</hi> and by which so many simple honest soules are deceived and led away to wonder after the beast.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:168340:3"/>
            <p>Therefore out of love to the honour, and glory of God, the welfare of the Saints, and true interest of the Nation and that glorious cause which we for so long time have beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and from a reall hatred, and detestation, of all Apostacy, backesliding and under hand dealing whatsoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply sencible of, and affected with the sad Condition, which at present the Nation is in, by reason of these things, and for the better information of others, doth your Freind who (in the strength of the Lord) desires to be faithfull in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, lay before you some passages and things, whereby such as feare the Lord (who if they knew it would doe no iniquity) might a little search into, examine, and consider things, and so comparing them with their former Ʋirgin Spirit, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, they may the better know how to steere their Course and to follow no man, nor things, further then they follow (or are for) Christ.</p>
            <p>And surely if we consider the eminent presence of God which was with the Army and us. All that time they were opposing of, and destroying the bloody Antichristian brood, which was in <hi>England, Scotland, and Ireland. (viz.</hi> the late <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Monarchy</hi> with the bishops, and that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and all the Appurtenances belonging to them) in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which so much of the Saints with others blood was shed, it cannot but bee matter of great astonishment and greife, to any honest, Vnbyast, ingenious heart to consider that they who professe to be Christians, and to have been so much called by the Lord to his worke, and have been so instrumentall in his hand, in destroying the Antichristian broode: should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding be setting themselves in many of the same pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and thinges, and thereby give nourishment to that which they had destroyed, which will plainly appear if you weigh and consider the things that follow.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, when the Army and others, who were real Friends to the Cause of God, which the Parliament in that day was an owner of, and shelter to, were at the beginning of the war taxed by Cavaliers, that We endeavoured to pull down the King and his Family, to set up one of our own chusing, it was generally denied by all, that we ever propounded it to our selves, or in the least intended such a thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And in a Declaration of the Army of <hi>June</hi> 14. 1647. p. 8, 9. they do positively declare, and affirm. That arbitrary or absolute power, in any person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> during life, doth not render that State any better then Tyranny; nor the People subject thereto, any better then Vassals, as appears in the words following, (say they) <hi>We are so far from designing and complying, to have an absolute or arbitrary power, signed and setled, for continuance, in any persons whatsoever,</hi> (much less then in one person during life) <hi>as that if we might be sure to obtain it, we cannot wish to have it so in the persons of any whom we our selves could most confide in, or who should appear most of our Principles and Opinions, or whom we might have most assurance of, or interest in, but that the Authority of the Nation in Parliaments may ever stand, and have its course, as the Supream Power and Trust,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the Case of the Army stated, and proposed by the Agents from <hi>Guilford,</hi> October 9. 1647, (say they) <hi>We took up Arms in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conscience, for the Peoples just Rights and Liberties; and not as mercenary Souldiers, hired to serve an arbitrary Power.</hi> So in pag. 15. <hi>That Parliaments rightly constituted are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our hopes, of Right and Freedom to the People.</hi> And in p. 16. <hi>This Supream and sole power in Parliaments, being a thing against which the King contended, and which the People have defended with their lives, and therefore ought more to be demanded, as the price of blood.</hi> And in p. 17. <hi>The many oppressions of the People, and the danger of absolute Tyranny, were the occasion of the expence of so much blood; so that the People have bought these their Rights and Freedoms by the price of blood.</hi> And many more passages are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168340:4"/> there to this purpose in their several Letters, Engagements, and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, before the King's head was cut off; all which do hold forth, that in that dispensation of things, there was not the least intention or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign (but on the contrary, a great aversness) to the bringing in of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power again; but that the Supream Authority and power of the Nation should be in the People, and their Rulers chosen by such as went along with God in his work, at that day, and were not (justly) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by him, for their opposition to it; and that the Supream power should not be in a King, or Monarch and his Councel any more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It being again charged upon the Army, and others of the People of God, who went on in the work of that day, a little before, and since the Kings head was chop'd off, (by the Cavaliers and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) that they did cast down the King and his Family, to set up the Man who is now in power; himself, as he then profest that he, so also the Army, to be sure, the people of God who then joyned with them, abhor'd the thoughts of such a <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed thing; as doth further appear by several Acts the Parliament made presently upon (and in some time after) the death of the late King (not yet repealed) which the people of God, above mentioned, with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and others joyned with: four of which Acts I shall make mention of, though I shall onely lay down the substance and matter of three of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1648. made the same day, or the day after the death of the King; which Act runs thus, <hi>viz. Whereas</hi> Charls Stuart <hi>King of</hi> England, <hi>being for the notorious Treasons, Tyrannies, and Murthers committed by him in the late unnatural and cruel wars, condemned to death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be it enacted and ordained by this present Parliament, and by Authority of the same, That no person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, do presume to proclaim, declare, publish, or any way promote</hi> Charls Stuart, <hi>son of the said</hi> Charls, <hi>commonly called the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>or any other person, to be King or chief Magistrate of</hi> England, <hi>or of</hi> Ireland, <hi>or of any the Dominions belonging to them or either of them by colour of inheritance, succession, election, or any other claims whatsoever, without the free consent of the people in Parliament, first had and signified by a particular Act or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for that purpose; any Statute, Law Ʋsage or Custome to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.

            <p>This Act, nor the other Acts, which you may read afterward, not being yet repealed by any Parliament, nor any thing that is like a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; considering also, that the last (called) Parliament did not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the now Protector (so called) in his Title and power, (which if they had done, would with Christ and the Saints have signified little, nay, nothing at all) he being also bound by his own (and his Creatures) <hi>Instrument of Government,</hi> as in Art. 6. which sayes, <hi>That no Laws shall be altered, suspended, abrogated or repealed, or new Laws made, nor any Tax, charge or imposition laid upon the people, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent in Parliament.</hi> By which it's evident, this Act (as I said before) not being yet repealed, stands good; you have it out of his own mouth, he is a Traytor, and all those who have been Aiders and Abettors, to him, and the Proclaimers of him. So that it is as lawful for any well-affected Person or Officer, to proceed to apprehend him, or them, and bring them before the next Justice of the Peace, as Traytors, &amp; so to receive condigne punishment, as it would have been to apprehend <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> or any of those persons who would have proclaimed him, or any other person, King, Protector, or chief Magistrate in that day. And there is more Law and right reason in so doing, (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a breach of several Acts, and the Engagement of Parliament, and contrary to so many Declarations, Protestations, and the Speeches of his and the Army in opposition to these things, as afterwards will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) then it is for him to suffer Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> to be imprisoned for his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion by Vertue of an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

               <hi>May</hi> 2. 1648. called, <hi>An Ordinance for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blasphemies and Heresies;</hi> it being onely, as they judge, an Error in Judgement, which hath not brought a quarter so much dishonor to God, and reproach upon the Saints and the Gospel, and strengthened the hands of wicked men, and such as hate the true breathings of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168340:5"/> Spirit, as his (I mean the Protector's) Error in practice, in going down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his blaspheming, persecuting, and imprisoning the Spirit of God in the Saints, hath done. I tell you Friends, This is Law and right Reason which I affirm; and it is onely the power of the Sword (which was never taken up to this end) which hinders it.</p>
            <p>And in another Act past <hi>March</hi> 17. following, intituled, <hi>An Act for the abolishing the Kingly Office in</hi> England, <hi>viz. Whereas</hi> Charls Stuart <hi>late King of</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c. is hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be justly condemned, and put to death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereby his posterity and all others pretending Title under him, are become uncapable of the said Crowns,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or to have the Name, Title, Stile, or Dignity, of King</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or to have the power or dominion of the said Kingdomes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or the Honours, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Lands, Tenements, Possessions, and Hereditaments, belonging or appertaining to the said Crown of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. And whereas it is, and hath been found by experience, that the Office of a King in this Nation, and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and to have the power thereof in any single person, is unnecessary, burthensome, and dangerous to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, safety, and publick interest of the people; and that for the most part use hath been made of the Regal Power and Prerogative, to oppress, impoverish, and enslave the Subject; and that usually and naturally, any one person in such power, makes it his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to incroach upon the just Freedom and Liberty of the people, and to promote the setting up of their own will and power above the Laws, that so they might enslave the Kingdoms to their own lusts: Be it therefore enacted and declared by this present Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Office of a King in this Nation shall not henceforth reside in, or be exercised by any one single person; and that no one person whatsoever, shall or may hold the Office, Stile, Dignity, or Power, or Authority of a King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if any Person or Persons shall by force of Arms, or otherwise, be aiding and assisting unto any persons that shall by any way and means be promoting any to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> (or to that purpose) <hi>That then every such offence shall be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adjudged high Treason,</hi> &amp;c. And so goes on, making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for such Offenders suitable to the forementioned Acts.</p>
            <p>Things are so obvious, and plain, and the reasons against Kingly or Protectorly Government so just and good, (which all acknowledged then, and of which we have such sufficient and woful experience of the Truth of now in this day) that I need not trouble my self nor you,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168340:5"/> to speak any further to this Act in this place, by way of explanation.</p>
            <p>There are also two other Acts of Parliament, which are before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; one of <hi>May</hi> 14. 1649. the other of <hi>July</hi> 17. following called, Acts declaring what Offences shall be adjudged Treason: they being to one purpose, I shall onely mention that of <hi>July</hi> 17. <hi>viz. Whereas the Parliament hath abolished the Kingly Office in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>&amp;c. and having resolved and declared, that the people shall for the future be governed by its own Representatives, or National meetings in Councel, chosen and entrusted by them for that purpose, hath setled the Government in the way of a Commonwealth &amp; Free-State, without a King and House of Lords: Be it enacted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That if any person shall maliciously or advisedly, publish, by writing, printing or open declaring, That the said Government is Tyrannical, usurped, or unlawful, and that the Commons assembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not the Supream Authority of this Nation: or shall plot, contrive or endeavour to stir up and raise force,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that then every such offence shall be taken, deemed, and adjudged by authority of this Parliament to be High Treason.</hi> And as by these Acts, so also by an Engagement drawn up and sent out by the Parliament about that time, for all in the Nation (who were concerned to take notice of it) to sign, to be faithful to the Government, as then establish'd, without a King and House of Lords; and for the not taking of which, many Ministers and others suffered in their Estates, and otherwayes; the Man in power being then Lieut. General: as also when he was chief Governour of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (not being fully gotten into the Saddle;) and the Army did stand by, upholding the Parliament in these Acts and this Engagement, and pleaded strongly, that they who opposed and refused might suffer.</p>
            <p>I cite these several passages, that ye may the better understand how opposite they were to Kingly Government in those dayes.</p>
            <p>Now if any shall weakly object, That the breaking up the old Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who (by the help of the Army and others of the people of God) changed the Government from Kingly into a Commonwealth, and made these Acts and Engagement before mentioned, was a breach of these Acts, and a frustrating the intents contained therein; and those who did it are become guilty of Treason, and so are liable to the penalties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appointed:</p>
            <p>My answer is, That the substance, scope, intent, and that which was mainly drove at, when those Acts were made, was not entailed upon the persons in the Government, as such, but to the Government it self, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168340:6"/> to that of a single person, and his Councel, (which way of Government was judged in that day to be such as did lay us open and leave us liable to Tyranny and Oppression, and the Arbitrary lusts, will and power of man, because that the persons of such a Councel are usually like a Nose of wax, which will winde and turn which way the single person pleases, especially if he be a man of courage, and sticks close to his Principles, (which he is acted by) and hath also a mercenary Army to bear him out in it; as our former, and present, experience doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare: so, whoever they are, who do, or shall now, submit to be of the Councel, with, or under such a single person or power, who is set up by a few, contrary to Law, and all those Declarations and Engagements, which have been sealed with so much of the Saints, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> others blood, and which the Lord hath so much witnessed against, being also without the desires, consent, and is such a grief to so many of his people; I say, that they who submit to act under such a person or power, especially in this day of Apostacy, it plainly declares they have not their eyes in their heads, and that they have somewhat within them, that will lead them to do as others have done, who were in the same places before them; whereby the people must of necessity be exposed to be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and slavery to the will of a man: which yoak and tyranny the Lord hath by so vast an expence of blood and treasure, delivered us from. But if those persons in that Government, I mean, that Parliament, do cease from the doing of that, which they were called unto it for, (as its well known they did) they were not to continue upon that account; &amp; therefore provision was made by the Army (in the day of their virginity) according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which the Saints who were most concerned joyned with, as appears in that paper drawn up by them, called, <hi>The Agreement of the people:</hi> which was presented to the House by some of the Colonels, <hi>&amp;c. Jan.</hi> 20. 1649. for which they had thanks returned them by the Speaker. I shall onely mention one particular of it, because it is to this purpose: VVe agree <hi>first, That to prevent the many inconveniences, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently arising from the long continuance of the same persons in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority this present Parliament end and dissolve upon or before the last day of</hi> April, <hi>in the yeer</hi> 1649. By which it's evident, that the end wherefore they were called unto those places, was chiefly aimed at, and not so much the persons themselves. The main scope and drift of that Agreement of the people, is wholly to have the Nation ruled by Parliaments or Representatives, and not by a single Person and his Councel.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:168340:6"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The great Man himself, as I am well informed, upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about Kingly Government, and upon some saying to him, That the Lord would not prosper the King, because he would set up wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by a Law, and countenance wicked men; and, that the Court was a Sink of wickedness; and if the Devil had a Nursery above ground, it was there: He replied again, <hi>He abhor'd that way of Government, for nothing more, then for the vast charge that went to maintain it, and the upholding such a company of loose persons about it.</hi> And I pray Friends, consider where he is now: is he not, though not in the same Name and Title, yet in the same power, and greater, and upholding many of the same things, as to the vanity, pride, idleness, and glory of this world, in his Court, Attendants, and Appurtenances, which cannot but be very chargeable to the Nation? in the doing of which he is to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. <hi>Thou that sayest another should not steal, dost thou steal? and that another should not commit adultery, dost thou commit,</hi> &amp;c. Thou that condemnedst the late King and that Government for these things dost thou take it up, and live in it, and do the same things thy self? <hi>dost thou think that thou shalt escape the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God?</hi> Rom. 2.3. And truely the first-fruits which lately fell to him at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> being Lord of the Soyle by vertue of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (I mean the Bastard which drop'd there) declares plainly, that Courts, with the glory and vanity of the world, with the luxury and idleness which attends them are the Sinks of wickedness; and, that such-like fruits will be the procedure of them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He did also say oftentimes, That whatever was like a King, he would fight against it, if it were for nothing else but the wickednesses and abominable sins which were comitted at the Court.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, An honourable person doth declare, That upon his telling the Man in power before he was Protector, That some were fearful that he would set up himself: in answer to which, he did profess, that if he thought there were such a Principle in him, he would presently run out of the world, or dig his own grave, and lie down and die there, or words to this purpose, and this not long before the little Parliament was turned out, and himself set upon their ruines: and yet you see he is upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most for all this, and every one else is below him and at his mercy.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, He sent up and down to the several Regiments, and made the Officers and Souldiers to set their hands and seals against the having a King or Lords, or chief Magistrate for time to come; that thereby they might the better remove the aspersions, which were cast upon them, of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168340:7"/> setting up themselves. And that he had a great hand in, and a good will to, the promoting of himself from his <hi>Excellency</hi> to his <hi>Highness,</hi> doth evidently appear by the several expressions and passages in his first and second Speeches, yea, and in the third, to the last (called) Parliament, in which he doth endeavour to commend himself, as, That <hi>he was by birth a Gentleman, and that he had been called to several employments in the Nation, and to serve in Parliaments, and that he endeavoured to discharge the duty of an honest Man in those services, and having when time was a competent acceptation in the hearts of men.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that he did see a period put to our sharp wars:</hi> and so goes on commending himself, which had been a great deal fitter for others to do, then he; and goes on ripping up the faults of the old Parliament, and the necessitie there was of their dissolution: and goes on speaking of the little Parliament succeeding, and speaks as slightly of them; and how he endeavoured to keep them together, but could not; and that the greatest part of them brought him a parchment signed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing the power to him; and so speaks, as if the power were appointed him of God; as also, commending the Government, what a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it was, and what it had done; as also, how it was owned by the several Ranks and Orders of men in the Nation; all which is spoken in his second Speech to them, when he kept them from going into the House till they had signed the Recognition, and by that submitted to, and owned the Government. Now he that runs may read this, that his speaking all this to them, by way of commending himself and the Government, and declaiming of others, by way of perswading them to acknowledge him Protector, when they so much refused it, (many of them being kept out of the House upon that account, because they would not sign it) doth plainly declare, that he was not so much called to it by others, but that rather himself, (and some with him) who would carry on a design of advancing themselves, desired to be setled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it, in order to the better carrying on of that design. All which things considered, and throughly looked into, comparing them with the several passages of his Speeches coming after, there will be found very foul and terrible flaws in all his evidences, which he layes down, whereby he would have us believe it's given him of the Lord; and that he hath not so good ground to commend them, as a Mountebank hath, who having gotten upon the stage, makes it his design to commend his Medicines beyond their worth.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, But besides all this, I pray you cast your eyes upon these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168340:7"/> passages of the Armies Declaration, going for <hi>Scotland</hi> in 1650. by which they hold forth, That they had wholly extirpated Kingly Government; and would acknowledge for the future, no King nor Monarch but Christ: And to have the Saints rule under him, was that which they prest unto; and would be for, till he came himself; as will appear in that which follows: in pag. 36. (say they) <hi>We found our hearts extraordinarily stirred up by the Lorld, to assist the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the King, being abundantly satisfied in our Judgments and Consciences, that we were called forth by the Lord, to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to bring about that which was our continual prayer to God,</hi> viz. <hi>the destruction of Antichrist, and the deliverance of his Church and People,</hi> &amp;c. In which very passage they acknowledge, That the King and his Monarchy, with the Bishops and that Hierarchy, were from the great Red Dragon, as the Beast and false Prophet of old, mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13. which false Prophet and Beast, is the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Scarlet-coloured Beast, mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.3. which Woman is the great Whore, whose name is Mystery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Harlots, who was drunk with the blood of the Saints and Martyrs, as is mentioned in the 5 <hi>vers.</hi> of that Chapter: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they judged (as well they might) That the same Spirit, in a degree, which ran in these, was also in the late King and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence they called them Antichrist, and were so much stirred up by the Lord (as they say) to oppose them: and after this do they call them the bloody Antichristian Brood: And why so? but because they stood upon that Foundation, and had the same Spirit with the Beast and false Prophet. They go on; <hi>And being perswaded in our Consciences, that he and his Monarchy was one of the ten Horns of the Beast, spoken of in</hi> Rev. 17.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>being witness to so much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood of the Saints he had shed in supporting the Beast,</hi> (that is, the King and his Monarchy &amp;c.) <hi>And considering the loud cries of the Souls of the Saints under the Altar, we were extraordinarily carried forth to desire justice upon the King.</hi> And why justice upon the King? (for this hath reference to the loud cries of the Souls of the Saints under the Altar, who were all along slain for the Word of God, and the Testimony which they held, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6 9.) but because he stood upon that Foundation of Monarchy, one of the ten Horns of the Beast, who (having drunk in the Whores Cup, and been Rid by her) have all along, one Generation after another, been found pushing at, persecuting, and shedding the blood of Saints: and according to their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168340:8"/> desires, as also the desires of many of the Saints, with others in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Head was chop'd off; and therein they did slay the Beast, and did cast aside all his Appurtenances belonging to him, which was his interest; sold most part of his Lands, Goods, Parks and Revenues; pulled down the Closet-Windows in his Chappel, where he used to look out to hear; and rased out his Arms out of Parish Churches, Courts of Judicature, and Ships that traded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Sea; and altering the great Seal: and doubtless it was the full purpose and resolution of the old Parliament, and the Saints (with others) both in and out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who went along in the work of God in that day never to espouse, build up, or take in that interest more; as appears by their assent unto the forementioned Acts the Parliament then made, as also the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And after this, do they say in the same Declaration before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. <hi>We are not Souldiers of fortune, nor meerly the servants of men; we have not onely proclaimed Jesus Christ King of Saints to be our King by profession, but do desire to submit to him upon his own terms to admit him to the exercise of his Royal Authority,</hi> as appears in 38▪ 39 Pages. And what can this hold forth, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as chiefly spoken to the Scots, upon their march thither, (as also that the Presbyterians and others, who were at home, and were for Monarchy, might take notice of it;) but that the setting up the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Government of Christ in the hands of the Saints till he comes himself, was that which they would be for, in opposition to the then King of Scots and his Monarchy, and so consequently to all future Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies whatsoever, considered as in the hands of any, but Christ alone? which doth further appear, in the 12 31, 38, 39 Pages: wherein they declare against any Government by one Man, or King, unless Christ Jesus; and do tell the Scots. <hi>That if they proceed in any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to bring in such a Government, as</hi> one Man or <hi>King upon us, they will blot out not onely their former merits</hi> (which was in helping us at first against the King) <hi>but undoe the noble Atchievements of the English Patriots and Parliaments in this and former Generations; for we know how easie a thing it is to raise a Monarchical Spirit; but how hard it is to keep it within its circle,</hi> &amp;c. And that they have now again so easily raised up a Monarchical Spirit, and do go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its circle far more in some things then the late King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel did, whose Tyranny, Injustice, and Oppression made the thoughts of Monarchy (or power in one Man and his Councel) so odious to them, declares they can prophesie truely in a bad matter.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:168340:8"/>
            <p>Ninthly, In another Declaration of the Army, after the old Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was broken up, in the yeer 1653. (say they) <hi>We judged it necessary, and agreed upon it▪ That the Supream Authority should be by Parliament devolved upon known persons, men fearing God, and of approved integrity; and the Government committed to them for a time, as the most hopeful way to encourage and countenance all God's people, reform the Law, administer justice impartially; hoping thereby the people might be weaned from Monarchy</hi> &amp;c. But notwithstanding they had slain that Beast and his bloody Brood, and cast out his interest, and all these Passages in their Declarations, and the Act of Parliament, with the Engagement against any for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet have they wickedly, without the least necessity for it (purposely to advance themselves, thereby to keep down the Spirit of Christ in them who would be pressing on further in the Work and Cause of God) given Life to another, and have set him upon his Legs, with his Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, like unto, and in things of highest concernment, worse then the former Beast, whose deadly wound is now healed, suitable to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11, 12. for a Protector and his Councel being risen up (with the help of a few others, in the Army, and elsewhere) &amp; broken in upon us; according to their so coming in, they have assumed to themselves, a more Tyrannical and Absolute Power, then the late King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel had; for he having gone down to <hi>Egypt</hi> himself, to the old Forms and Customes of the Nation, as to his Power and Title, suitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he brings up a Parliament with him, which is such pitiful Metal, as he can purge and break them at his pleasure, and that upon his own account; whenas it was a high breach of Priviledge in the late King, and that which could not be born with, to come and demand but five Members out of the House.</p>
            <p>But before I come to speak any thing as to the choice of the last (called) Parliament, I shall endeavour to lay before you the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealing which was used in the setting up the Man who is now in power.</p>
            <p>Those godly men who were left behinde in the little Parliament, being turned our by Colonel <hi>Goffe,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>White,</hi> (with the help of some Souldiers they brought with them;) there was in a very little time after, <hi>An Instrument of Government for the Nation</hi> produced; which Government was to be managed by a single person, and a Councel consisting of the number of one and twenty Persons joyned with him; and a Parliament, which was to sit half a yeer once in every three yeers,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168340:9"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the so suddain coming forth of which Instrument, declares plainly, that it was not a new thing, but that which was thought of, contrived, and appointed some time before those Friends (before mentioned) were turn'd out of the House; and all this done by five, or six, or very few more, as is confidently reported, and believed: there being several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army that will not stick to say as much; and, which is also evident by this; for though they were all generally sent for upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being taken into the consultation; yet when they came thither, they did little else but walk to and fro in the Rooms without, whilst the business was carried on by a few within; and staying several times very late at Night, still expecting to be sent for in, Major-General <hi>Lambert</hi> comes out to them, and tells them they might go home, for there was no occasion at that time to make use of them: to that to me it clearly appears, their being sent for, was onely for this end the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour over and cloak their design, which was, to hold forth the business was done by the general consent of the Officers, when it was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so: which is plainly jugling and deceit.</p>
            <p>The Instrument being thus perfected, the business contained therein must be put into execution, which was also carried on as privately as the other. The day being appointed, the Commissioners of the great Seal, the Judges, the Lord Major and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. were sent to, to come with all speed, and give their presence and assistance, to help deliver, and to solemnize the birth of the revived Brood of Antichrist, to set up and proclaim the Beast-like power of a Protector and his Councel, which formerly had been destroyed.</p>
            <p>These poor Creatures, whose Predecessors (for the generality) have all along, one Generation after another, to this very day, been enemies to the true breathings of the Spirit of Christ in the Saints, opposers of his work, and supporters of the Spirit of the Beast and false Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an <hi>Issachar</hi>-like Spirit and minding their Riches, Honour, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Safety more then their Consciences, the Honour and Glory of God, and the just Liberties and Priviledges of the Nation, came, after a short warning (some of them) hand over head, with the rest of the crowd, scarce knowing or well unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>standing what they did a (it may well be said so;) for several of the Officers of the Army, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do protest, (and that is the excuse which they make for themselves, yet for all this do keep their places) That, though they went along to the Hall with the rest of the Company, where the business was done, yet they knew not what it was they went about, till the Man was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168340:9"/> Protector; yet notwithstanding this, he would have you understand and believe him, that the business was not carried on by a few, but by the whole Company, which was there, as appears in the 15<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
               <hi>page</hi> of his second Speech made to the last (called) Parliament, where he sayes, <hi>I had the presence of the Lords Commissioners of the great Seal, the Lord Major and Aldermen of the City the Judges, and the Officers of the Army, and the Souldiery,</hi> (excepting none) <hi>and</hi> (sayes he) <hi>it was not done in a corner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Truely, to me it were as good be done in a corner, as to have the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Bodies there, and they to know nothing of it before it was done: The Lord knows, it was a meer surprize to thousands which were there, who were ignorantly drawn in with the rest of the crowd to sin against the Lord, and to be Traytors to their Country, in the breach of their Vows, Declarations, and Engagements made to the Lord and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the day of our streights; and yet he can boast of this (as to their being there) as if it were an eminent and approved providence of God; whenas there is rather greater reason, that he should confess (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of) his own sin, in alluring them in ignorance to sin, and in so cheating of them (as also theirs;) and pray unto the Lord to forgive them: for (though he did yet) they knew not what they did. For my part, when I seriously weigh and consider the several circumstances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his exaltation, it cleerly appears to me its a stol'n thing; for if it were not so, and he had not a purpose to surprize us, why was he not so plain above-board as his Predecessors were, (the former Kings and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eens of <hi>England</hi>) to let us know some time beforehand, what he did intend to do, and the day of his Coronation? which they usually did. But for brevity sake, I shall say no more to that at this time.</p>
            <p>The Government being carried on thus far, the now new Courtiers, (who for counselling their Master to these crooked wayes, whereby he hath almost lost the love of the Saints, may well be compared to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>'s green Heads, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.8▪ 10, 11.) did of themselves draw up a Writing by way of an Address to the Protector, as if it had come freely from the Officers and Souldiers of the Army of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and as if undesired by him and them in power: the Title of which runs, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </gap>d</hi> &amp;c. The scope of which is very much in applauding him, &amp; also very much to pray and beseech him to take the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168340:10"/> Government and Title of Protector upon him; and is done with such fine Language, as if so be they had desired and wooed him to accept of it; and that it was rather their desire then his: when it was not so, but was invented and drawn up at Court, and sent to them, and they wooed and desired to sign it. Nay, some did threaten (who are of the greatest at Court) that those of the Army who would not close with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and sign the Address, that they might and should leave the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet notwithstanding their entreaties and threats, the signing of it was refused by almost all the Officers of some Regiments, more especially the Protectors own Regiment of Foot; &amp; although he himself did spend at least four hours together, endeavouring by arguments to perswade them; yet for all this, they refused the signing of it, till they had made some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in it themselves; and having yielded to sign it then, (poor hearts) it did however so grate upon their Consciences, as that some of the most spiritual and conscientious among them, have since, as dissatisfied with the Government, laid down their Commissions, and have left the Army; as also some Officers of other Regiments since have done the like.</p>
            <p>And such Officers both in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as are eminent, honest, and faithful, and are taken notice of to disapprove of the Government, are suspended from their Commands, and some of them have their Commissions taken away upon that account.</p>
            <p>And I pray, Friends what means Major General <hi>Harrison</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> Major General <hi>Overton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Okey,</hi> Colonel <hi>Alured.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Wiggan,</hi> Captain <hi>Rigby</hi> Captain <hi>Harrison,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Portman,</hi> Secretary of the Navy, Cornet <hi>Day,</hi> and others of the Officers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to be taken away, and laid down, and others put into their Commands and Places? so what means the Petition which was stifled in the birth by the Court-party in an illegal manner before it could come forth, the Copy of which is since printed, and signed by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Okey,</hi> Colonel <hi>Saunders,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Alured,</hi> and would have been signed by more Colonels and other Officers had they not been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised? which Petition declared to the Protector, how contrary the Government was to former Declarations and Engagements, and what dangerous consequences it would be of, and wholly refusing to subscribe the Address.</p>
            <p>And while they were about this Petition (contrary to honesty reason and justice) they were seized upon, and in an illegal manner restrained of their liberty, Col. <hi>Alured</hi> being in custody for it at this day, which is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168340:10"/> almost three quarters of a yeer: yet the Court-Erectors, who it's judged were great Instruments in bringing in this Aegyptian yoke, and of hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this cockatrice egge, could in the mean time (notwithstanding so many of the Officers were dissatisfied, in and about the head-Quarters) send their Letters to the several Officers of the Regiments in the three Nations, to encourage and stir them up to sign the Address, which they sent inclosed unto them; and tell them in these words (after mentioning the Instrument) <hi>viz. The Lord General</hi> Cromwel, <hi>is by the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument declared the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of</hi> England; <hi>who hath accepted thereof, and was according to general satisfaction sworn in</hi> Westminster-Hall <hi>in the presence of the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the Army, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And let us further inform you, that our selves, and the Officers and Souldiers, that now reside in and about the Head Quarters have thought it our duty to strengthen the hands of his Highness as much as in us lies; and for that purpose, have made our Addresses in the form herewith sent unto you,</hi> &amp;c. This Letter was sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> signed by Major-General <hi>Lambert,</hi> Commissary-General <hi>Whaly,</hi> Colonel <hi>Goffe,</hi> Colonel <hi>Thomlinson,</hi> &amp;c. By which you may see how earnest and industrious they were to advance their design and Kingdom, though they build it with lyes.</p>
            <p>For this is a manifest and plain untruth, for them to say the Protector was sworn to general satisfaction; whenas it appears by the several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (before mentioned) dissatisfactions, there was no such thing: and whereas they would have them to believe, that themselves with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers, which did reside in and about the Head-Quarters did think it their duty to strengthen the hands of his Highness, as much as in them lay it was and is, another untruth; for many of the Officers both at and about the Head-Quarters, were at the same time, as was said before very much dissatisfied: nay, I will be bold to say thus much more, that if the Hearts and Consciences of most of those who have, and others who have not subscribed, (yet seem to be satisfied) could be searched into you would finde very notable gratings, and gripings, and wishings, Oh! that this Government had never been set up; and would bless the Lord with all their hearts, if it were down to morrow; and that they might return again to their former virgin-Spirit and Principle which they had for God, his Work and People, in the day of their streights; and that they might be acting suitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168340:11"/> Whatever the Higher Powers and their Creatures, would have you to believe, these things thus laid down, are clearly so: yet notwithstanding this, you shall finde the Protector telling the last Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, in pag. 18. of his second Speech, saying thus: <hi>I had the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Officers of the Army in the three Nations of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland; <hi>I say, of the Officers, I had that by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances and under signature,</hi> &amp;c. Which is a very falshood; for how can this stand with the forementioned Major-Generals, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Majors, and others, who did oppose and detest it, as an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing?</p>
            <p>And, as to his boasting of their signing the Address, alas! what is that but as it were a thing forced from them, rather then coming freely of themselves of their own accord; which it must do, if he make it cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear, that they set him up, and not he himself: truely, to me it's very little less then a compulsatory way; and it is not at all hard, to make that good, because that all those who will not sign and submit to it, and will be faithful to their Light, and in word and carriage let it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to be sure, they shall be look'd upon, as no Friends to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and shall be dealt withal accordingly, as many are at this day.</p>
            <p>But truely, these Places and Commands do stick so close to many or most of them, that yet remain in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they will stretch their Consciences to the utmost pin, rather then part with them, in bearing a Testimony suitable to their Light, against those evils which they cannot but acknowledge they are living in; which poor, base, and unworthy frame of Spirit in them, hath betrayed the good old cause of God, and hath, and doth, very much strengthen the new Courtiers hands, in their Apostacy and back-slidings. For my part, I am so well satisfied in the Truth of what I say, that I can honestly lay down my life in the belief and saying of it.</p>
            <p>And yet you shall finde in the Protector's last Speech, to the last (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) Parliament, when he came to dissolve them, as appears in page 30, 31. that his setting up was cleerly the approved providence of God, and according to his good will and pleasure; and utterly declaims the wisdom, power, policy, and contrivance of man, as in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: <hi>It was, say some, the cunning of the Lord Protector, (I take it to my self) it was the craft of such a man, and his plot, that hath brought it about; and as they say in other Countries, There are five or six cunning men in</hi> England, <hi>that have skill, they do all these things: Oh! what blasphemy is this,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Those men that live
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168340:11"/> upon their Mumpsimus and Sumpsimus, their Masses and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>no wonder, if they be strangers to God, and the works of God, and to spiritual dispensations. And because they say and believe thus, must we do so too? We in this Land have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise instructed, even by the Words, Works and Spirit of God.</hi> (Truly, he might well say of us, That we were led by our Mumpsimusses and Sumpsimusses, and had no light or understanding but from the Mass and Service-Books, if we could not take notice of their cunning and jugling in these things.) He goes on: <hi>To say that men bring forth these things, when God doth them; judge you if God will bear this. I wish that every sober heart, though he hath had temptations upon him of deserting the Cause of God, yet may take heed how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes, and falls into the hands of the living God by such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as these,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They that shall attribute to this or that person, the contrivances and productions of those mighty things God hath wrought in the midst of us, and that they have not been the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ himself, upon whose shoulders the Government is laid; they speak against God, and they fall under his hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mediator. That is, if we deny the Spirit of Christ the glory of all his works in the world, by which he rules Kingdomes, we provoke the Mediator, and he may say, I'll leave you to God, I'll not intercede nor mediate for you; thou fallest into the hands of the living God. Therefore whatsoever you may judge men for, and say, This man is cunning and politick, and subtil; take heed again, I say, how you judge of his revolutions, as the product of mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends, I pray take notice of these words; for they have an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (because of the seemingness of Truth they bear, as also from the confidence with which they are spoken) to be spoken as by an Angel of Light; but those who pretty well know the transactions and carriage of things, whatever gloss he puts upon the business, may honestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort upon him, (as from that which hath already and afterward will appear) that expression of his, which in a reproachful manner he did cast upon those of the fifth Monarchy-Principle, in a Speech to some chief Officers of the City, <hi>viz. That they had tongues like Angels, but had cloven feet:</hi> which was untruely and unworthily spoken of them; for though they have their infirmities and failings, (as who hath not?) yet the Lord hath so ordered it in their hearts, that they would do no iniquity. But for him to speak so confidently, that what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168340:12"/> hath been done in the setting of him up, was so cleerly and plainly the approved and good providence and appointment of God, when its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and doth so plainly appear, that it's done by the power, policy, and contrivance of man; it argues cleerly, that those high words, (the actions being so unsuitable, and contrary) do proceed not from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, but from the Spirit of the Dragon, Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which he had suck'd in, and had a tincture of, some time before and since he came to be Protector; the foundation of which Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is laid upon and supported by the <hi>Cloven foot.</hi> And as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as he seems to be on the one hand, (as appears by his words, which he would have all to believe) that his call to the Government is approved of, and appointed by God; so more confident and certain is your Friend on the other hand, that it is not so; but rather by the permissive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, brought forth by the power, policy and subtil contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of man, as a Thief takes another man's purse upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>And whereas he would have us believe, That if we say he is set up by the wisdom of man, it is to deny the Spirit of Christ in his actings in the World, and provokes the Mediator; and so we bring destruction upon our selves;</p>
            <p>My answer is, I am not of his minde; first, because as I am very well satisfied, that he is really and indeed set up by the cunning, contrivance, policy, and deceit of man; and being so, it's not by the Spirit of Christ: So secondly, on the other hand, his standing and appearance upon this foundation, with his appurtenances to, and attendants about him, and all circumstances considered, there is not to me the least ground to judge, That the Spirit of Christ is in it.</p>
            <p>For first, the Monarchical foundation on which he stands, is that which the Lord by his Spirit in his People, and by their hands without them, hath destroyed: remember, the Blood of the Saints, with others, which hath been shed in the doing of it: consider also, the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Engagements against it, sealed with that blood; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons now slain, had they in the least imagined, that the Beast-like power of a single person and his Councel would have been set up again, after so large an expence of blood and treasure in opposition to it, would never have gone forth.</p>
            <p>So secondly. If you consider the evident and apparent injustice, and oppression, which is done by them, in sending men to prison without shewing any cause why; and keeping them there at pleasure, without
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168340:12"/> bringing to Tryal, in an Arbitrary and Tyrannical way: which is a shame to be mentioned, that such things should be done in this day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you consider the vast charge and expence there is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Government; as also the vanity, idleness, luxury, and fashioning themselves to the World, in those about it; the sad effects whereof, the first-fruits (before mentioned) that fell to him at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> declares, That Courts (let them do what they can) will be Nurseries for the Devil; for that Spirit which is for the setting up Courts and the glory of the World, is suitable to it.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, They have now, as was formerly, the Spirit of the Beast and his Chaplains among them, which doth brow-beat, reproach, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and endeavour to keep under the true Spirit of Christ, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves within the gate; who desire to be faithful to their light, and to follow him in the regeneration, as to the work of their Generation; nay, all these things are worse now, then they were in some time before, since the Lord began to do any thing among us, in order to the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us from these abominations.</p>
            <p>Now it's evident to me, the Lord having begun his work, and been one time after another, more refined in his dispensations, still taking out of the way, that which hindred the carrying on of Justice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; delivering the oppressed, and breaking yokes, and throwing down our Idols, the outward honour, pomp, pride and greatness of the World; it's very unsuitable to him, having begun in the Spirit, to end in the Flesh; to go down to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to be building again the things which he hath destroyed.</p>
            <p>I must declare my judgement clearly: my expectations are, That every step of Christ among us, not onely within us, but as to his work in the World too, for the future, will be more refined and spiritual; and he will not make use of the wisdom, policy, pomp, and glory of the World, these old base rotten things which stink in his nostrils, and which have been cast out, to carry on his work withal, and to win the Nations to him; but will come forth with more Justice and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with a People more refined for, and suited to, that work, and that from his Spirit, being powerful within them, which leads them forth to delight in him, and do his will; which frame within them, will trample upon all that pomp and glory in the World which naturally the heart is taken with: and if it be not so with them, they can never be fit for the work he hath to do.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:168340:13"/>
            <p>When Christ steps in among us, so as to rejoyce the hearts of his People, and to proceed visibly in his work, persons who would heal <hi>Babylon</hi> and the deadly wound of the Beast, and would (or could) not go along with God in former dispensations, but left him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to shift for themselves, shall not stand in his sight, so as to be used by him, except they have a higher and better Principle given to them.</p>
            <p>For my part, I profess as in the presence of the Lord, I cannot see any one thing, either in the rearing of this Government up, or now that it is up, or in any thing about it, that hath the least appearance that the Lord is there, or in the least approves of it; but rather the contrary: for it's as evident as the Sun that shines, their actions declare it, That they are gone down into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the old Forms, Customs, and Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Nation, which they themselves have abhor'd, and have been instrumental to cast out. So that all things considered, it's clear to me, I do not oppose the Spirit of Christ in his actings, in what I affirm, as to his being set up by the wisdom of man: and therefore shall not in the least fall under the hand of God without a Mediator.</p>
            <p>And because I believe I am upon a better foot of account, to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as to this particular, then he is; I shall desire him, who is so ready to advise and warn others, (as if he were the Standard, and had all the right and light on his side) to take heed, lest by his continuing in his Apostacy, and back-sliding, and trampling upon that Spirit and Principle, which he once owned, and profess'd to be of, and for which the Lord hath owned him, he come into the same condition himself, which he so much bids others to beware of. And so much as to the manner of his being set up, and to the several passages of his Speeches, as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>I shall now endeavour the discovery of the Mystery of Iniquity in the choice of the last (called) Parliament, and in the ordering of it to be so chosen; which will appear if you consider what the Protector (then Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) said in his Speech to the little Parliament in the Councel-Chamber before their sitting in the yeer 1653. sayes he, in <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>We did tell them</hi> (meaning the old Parliament) <hi>that to send out an Act of Parliament into the Country, to have qualifications in an Act to be the Rules of Electors and Elected, and not to know who should execute this, was the way to have the next Parliament to consist all of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; and that those qualifications therein contained, would not hinder nor keep out neither them nor Neuters. And though it be our desire to value and esteem of that Judgement, onely they having
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168340:13"/> been, as we know, having deserted this Cause and Interest, upon the Kings account, and the closure between them and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Nation; we do think, we must profess, we had as good have delivered up our Cause into the hands of any, as into the hands of interessed and biass'd men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And again, in page 25. of the same Speech, doth speak of the danger that there is in bringing in of such men; and presses very hard for to have godly men, and men of Principles: (sayes he) <hi>If I were to chuse the meanest Officer in the Army or Commonwealth, I would chuse a godly man that hath Principles; especially where trust is to be committed, because I know where to have a man of Principles. I believe if any man of you should chuse a Servant, you would do so; and I would all our Magistrates were so chosen, that may be some effects of this. It's our duty to chuse men that fear the Lord, to praise the Lord; yea such as the Lord forms for himself, and he expects not praises from others,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Friends, Here are excellent taking words; he did run well, and began in the Spirit, and seemed to be pressing on; but he having since this turned off from them to whom it was chiefly intended; (those Friends who were turned out of the little Parliament, whose Principles (to act suitable thereunto) are beyond what theirs were, who pretended to bring the power to him) and in so doing, declining from and putting away his former honest Principle, and having taken the Government upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which he had formerty so much condemned, and had been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to destroy; having thus ended in the Flesh, it was requisite that he do something suitable to it, and therefore he went down to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> to the old Forms and Customs of the Nation, as in the late King's dayes, to chuse a Parliament, though with somewhat more refinedness then formerly, as in 14, &amp; 15 Article of the Instrument, which he could not but know, the honest Party being dissatisfied with the Government, and therein declining his design, must of necessity produce such Persons, as that although he was not without some hopes, from their being so poorly principled, as to sit by vertue of such a Call, <hi>viz.</hi> (by a Power which is Arbitrary and usurp'd) as also by such Persons as in the general did come to chuse them; they might with the help of the other Party of the House, being most of them Officers of the Army, State, &amp; Universities, his Kindred and houshold-Servants (who are his Creatures) be brought for to establish him; yet when they had done so, he could not but know (as I said before) it must produce persons whose Principles would be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168340:14"/> such (being most of them chosen hy Presbyterians, Neuters, and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers) and many of them being so chosen, being such themselves; nay, one of them was a Papist, (which is exceedingly contrary to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned passages of his Speech to the little Parliament) that of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity would be infringing the liberties of the People of God, especially as to spirituals, which had formerly been purchased by the blood and lives of so many of their Brethren.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding this, you shall finde in the 2 page of his first Speech to them, in the painted Chamber, saying, <hi>&amp;c. After so many changes and turnings which this Nation hath laboured under, to have such a day of hope as this is, and such a door of hope opened by God unto us; truely I believe some months since would have been above all our thoughts.</hi> And so goes on with a great deal more to this purpose, which will be too tedious to insert; onely I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion something which is remarkable, as in the 8 page of that Speech, where he layes before them the condition of the Nation, as to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals: (sayes he) <hi>Indeed in spiritual things the case was more sad and deplorable, and that was told you this day eminently,</hi> (viz. in the Sermons at the <hi>Abby</hi> before their fitting) <hi>the prodigious blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, contempt of God &amp; Christ, denying of him and his Ordinances, and of the Scriptures, a Spirit visibly acting those things foretold by</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Jude; <hi>yea those things spoken by</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Timothy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so proceeds in speaking to them after this manner; as if he had gotten such persons, and so spiritual, as were capable of those things which he spake to them about; whenas he well knew, that the greatest part of them were such as in his Speech to the little Parliament (before mentioned) he declaimed against, as unfit for the work of the Day, or to be entrusted with that glorious Cause which was carrying on (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyters and Neuters.) Yet these men were enstrusted by him to take care of spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ual concernments; and where they judged any thing out of the way, or erring in that Case, they should help to set it right; using that expression of <hi>Jude: Of some have compassion, making a difference: others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire,</hi> (says he) <hi>I fear they will give opportunity too often for this exercise; and I hope the same will be for their good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it's worth our taking notice, that the drift of all this was chiefly, to stir them up to fall upon those of the fifth Monarchy-Principle, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their speakings or writings, or any other way they had opposed him.</p>

            <p>Pray Friends consider what he sayes to the little Parliament concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saints of differing judgements, and see what agreement it hath with that before mentioned to the last Parliament; truely, to me there is no more agreement then between <hi>brains</hi> and <hi>stairs.</hi> After, speaking, that the Lord had wrought all our deliverances for the good of the whole flock: (sayes he) <hi>Therefore I beseech you, (but I think I need not) have a care of the whole Flock, love all the Sheep, love the Lambs; love all, and tender all, and cherish all, and countenance all, in all things that are good. And if the poorest Christian, the most mistaken Christian should desire to live peaceably &amp; quietly under you, soberly and humbly desire to lead a life in godliness &amp; honesty, let him be protected.</hi> Wherefore, upon this account Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> who though a mistaken Christian, yet living peaceably, quietly, soberly, and desiring to lead a life in godliness and honesty, (as it's said by them who well know him He doth; as he also did when these good words were spoken) was and is to have his Liberty as well as the rest of the Flock.</p>
            <p>But by all these clashings and interferings in his Speeches, you may perceive, that although he be upon the Foundation of the Beast, and hath drunk in of that Spirit, yet he hath so much the eyes of a man, as he knows how to suit his words to the several parties and things which speaks unto.</p>
            <p>Now that he should speak such words to these men whom he knew were not capable to receive and bear them, being also so exceeding contrary to his former Sectarian Spirit, Principle and Practice, when he made it his work to gather the Sectaries about him, looking upon them as the onely men for the work he had to do; that he should now, after he hath served his end upon them, (to get into the Saddle) which in all their fightings and shedding of blood they never intended; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they now oppose him for this wickedness, for him to turn off from them, and to joyn with the Lord Major, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who for the greatest part of them cared not for us in the day of our streights, and went on in the work against the enemy no further then the fasety of their own interest was concerned, and are not thorow Friends to the true breathings of the Spirit; as also to encourage his Officers, or Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, those Messengers of Satan, to reproach, persecute, and imprison the Saints, who were his truest Friends; the consideration of it would make any honest man's heart to bleed: but you may see (as I said before) he hath a word for every turn and purpose; and the last shall still be the best (with him) let the thing be good or bad which he speaks unto.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:168340:15"/>
            <p>Truly there are such contradictions in his Speeches, and between them and his actions, that it's a very hard thing to finde whereabout he is. The consideration of it, hath often put me in minde of those words in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.18, 19. <hi>There be three things which are too wonderful for me; yea, four, which I know not: the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a Serpent upon a rock, the way of a Ship in the midst of the Sea, and the way of a man with a maid.</hi> And if it were honest and lawful to add to Scripture, one might put in a fifth thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The way of a Protector in his Speeches, and between them and his actions; for no man that follows him there, is able to finde him out.</p>
            <p>I have made too long a digression, by reason of the passages in his Speeches; I shall now proceed.</p>
            <p>I said, most of these men who were of the last (called) Parliament, were so principled, as that they would be infringing the People of God of the Liberty of their Consciences; which he could not but know: and when they were going on to do so, if he should presently interpose and hinder them from it, by laying first one part of them aside, and after that turn out the other, pretending the preservation of the Saints Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were in danger of being infringed, as one of the grand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, he would thereby so ingratiate himself with them, as to win them for the future wholly to his interest, and thereby the more firmly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish himself, and carry on his design to keep down them of the fifth Monarchy Principle, who are the People that he most fears, and looks upon as his greatest enemies, because no friends to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For although that in his Speeches to the last (called) Parliament, he makes his boast that he had the Judges Lords Majors, Majors, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, high-Sheriffs, under-Sheriffs, grand Juries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that owned him, and approved of his setting up, and were fully for his interest; yet he doth but make use of them as his pack-horses, to help bear his burden, and do his drudgery; and dares not trust them any further, because he knows very well, that notwithstanding they now crouch under him, yet if ever they have a fair opportunity, either upon <hi>Charls Stuarts,</hi> or the Presbyterians account, to shew themselves, and he be not able any longer either to curb or uphold them they will quickly be weary, and throw off their burthen; and will make no more bones of it, to turn in with the next Governour or Governours that are uppermost, whether good or bad, then the Sword-bearer and Officers of the City, who cry, Grace, Grace, and bow unto one Lord Major to day, and turn off from him to serve another the next. And he knowing that his main rest and safety is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168340:15"/> bound up in the Saints: therefore (if it be possible) he will make sure of them; yet will carry it so wisely, as not to displease and leave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till he needs must: and to make the Silver and the Clay go on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Mystery of Iniquity is hard at work; and blessed be the Lord, that by his Spirit poured forth, we begin to discover him: and some poor Creatures have through their simplicity and weakness been caught by this bait already, as appears by the endeavours of some in that Acknowledgement which was drawn up in <hi>Kent,</hi> or rather by some of the Court-Drivers at <hi>London,</hi> who are of the Judgement with the baptized Churches there, and sent down thither to be signed, as if drawn up by, and coming freely from themselves to the Protector; which runs, <hi>&amp;c. That had we no other obligation lay upon our Spirits, then your great care and respects, continually manifested towards us, and that much more now, in having your negative voice; It were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bespeak our continual thankfulness to your Highness, and declare your faithfulness and noble actions to the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and are hereby encouraged, to assure your Highness, that we perceive so much of God in your undertakings, for the preservation of such as fear God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that we should count our selves unworthy, if we should now be silent, or withhold from contributing to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a suitable proportion of whatever God hath given us,</hi> &amp;c. And so goes on with such sweet and wooing expressions by way of owning him, as was in the Address, which the Army was, and many of them is yet to sign; which Acknowledgement was cast out by several of the Saints both in and out of the Churches, as an abominable thing.</p>
            <p>Now the Benefit and Vertue of his Negative-voice, which they so much magnifie him for, was then manifested, in breaking up the last Parliament, who (as they apprehended) would have crushed them.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, which is very observable, that I may not let pass, though I do a little digress: You see, as before mentioned, the charge he gives the Parliament to save some of the Erronious Persons, pulling them out of the Fire. Now according to the encouragement he gave them, they were going on suitable to their Principles, and were setting up an Assembly of Divines, and were pressing on upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and this, before the House was purged of those who would not sign the Paper, which was to acknowledge him Protector: the other Party (who stayed behinde and signed it before they were broken up) were a going on upon the Presbyterian strain as well as the former and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168340:16"/> would have been curbing those called Anabaptists; which they might have done by vertue of the forementioned Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, which sayes, <hi>That all such as do publish and maintain that the baptizing Infants is unlawful or such Baptism is void, or, that such Persons ought to be baptized again; and shall baptize any person formerly baptized; or, that the Churches of</hi> England <hi>are no true Churches, nor their Ministers and Ordinances true Ministers and Ordinances; or, that the Church-Government by Presbytery, is unlawful or Antichristian,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>such persons, so maintaining, may, if any do complain of them, be brought before two Justices of Peace, who have power to order them to renounce the said Errors in the publick Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now when they were falling roundly upon those who are for the Baptism of Believers, and would have hindred them of their Liberty; one of them being a Member of the House, was necessitated to stand up in opposition to what was said against hem, using the same expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. That <hi>after the same way which you call Heresie, do I worship the God of my Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. And then some others of the Court-party stood up, &amp; said, That they had ventured their Lives and Estates in the War to preserve the Nation, and therefore they had a Right to their Liberties as well as others: and a great stir was kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> about this.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> was sent to Prison, and his Book burn'd; and it was press'd strongly he should be put to death; and none were suffered to come to him.</p>
            <p>Things being so, it was look'd upon by many who fear the Lord, to be very unsutable to the dayes we live in, which should be dayes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Whereupon, some Pastors, and several Members of Churches, being very much affected with it, after their meeting together, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to come to the Protector to complain of it, and to get a Redress. In the mean time the Parliament bore the brunt of all the hard Censures of the godly People for these things; whenas they did no other, then what their Principles and Judgements led them to; and nothing less could be expected from them.</p>
            <p>Now if any were to be blamed for this, it was the Protector, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the fault clearly was in him: first, in giving way that such a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168340:16"/> should be chosen. And secondly, that he suffered them so long to go on in the doing of such things. Now in regard they would not answer his desires, to establish him in the Government, nor in those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which were suitable to it this was a business which fell as pat as heart could wish; for by this means he had an opportunity, as to ingratiate himself with the People of God, so also the better to colour the business, and strengthen himself when he went to dissolve them. Now here is the Knack and Mystery of this Iniquity: first, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them to their work, to fall upon the Erronious Persons; and when they are about it, he recommends and sets off the goodness of his Government, and ingratiates himself with the People, in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of them; and this was that which took the poor simple heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creatures (before mentioned) who were to sign the Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Whereas if they had had their eyes in their heads, and had rightly understood things, and had been endued with a Spirit of Courage and Boldness for God indeed, and had known when the Spirit of Christ in his Saints was bounded and hindered from a vigorous going on in the work of God, as (if they know what the Spirit and Righteousness is) they cannot but say it was, (in turning out those friends who were left behinde in the little Parliament) they (in stead of their bowing to and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him) should have asked him, Why he turned out their Brethren (those of the little Parliament, who stayed behinde in the House, who were a going on in the Work of God, and would have made such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the future, as that the hands and mouths of Oppressors and Persecutors should in every respect have been tied and stopped) and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped the Government to himself, whereby he was necessitated, if he would have a Parliament to sit under him, to make use of men of such persecuting Principles (as many of the last Parliament were:) for no man who really and indeed minded the Honour and Glory of God, the welfare of the Saints and Nation, more then his pay and outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments or had not been left behinde in former dispensations, or had had a clear light in, taste of, and a love to, the glorious work of God, which by the Spirit is prophesied of, and promised shall be brought forth in the later dayes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. so <hi>Psalm.</hi> 72. and <hi>Isai.</hi> 32.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and, which the reproached persecuted and imprisoned Saints in the midst of their infirmities, through the strength and Spirit of Christ are pressing after) would have been of so poor a Spirit, as to have appeared or sate by vertue of the Call of an usurped
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168340:17"/> Power, or from such Persons, as by the Instrument had liberty (and as in the general did come) to chuse them.</p>
            <p>And although that some of you who I hope are real friends to Christ, the Saints, and Nation, from right aims and ends, did meet when that Parliament (so called) was to be chosen, and did not in the least intend in your coming together to own the present Power, but onely to do your Country service if you had been chosen; yet I must tell you, (and I pray bear with me in it) That all that which you would have built, would have been but as Hay and Stubble, because that neither the Foundation on which you would have built, nor your Call to such a Work, was right and clear; and whatever you may think of it, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it as well as you can) it was in some measure an owning the Power: but you see the Lord did not prosper what was upon your hearts in that particular; for the Presbyterian Clergy, Neuters, and some Cavaliers, as also some Pastors of Churches, did so prevail, that for the generality ye were not chosen; but those few of you who were, as you went in, so ye came came out: and therefore be sure for the time to come, that ye look throughly, before you leap, and that you set the Lord before you, and approve your hearts to him; and let all you do, be by as pure and clear a light as is possible; and let not one word be spoken▪ or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be done by you, that may give the Spirit of the Beast the least advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or may in the least grate upon or weaken the Cause and Interest of Christ, or grieve his Spirit in the imprisoned Saints, which follow him in the Regeneration, in reference to his coming and Kingdom without; as it it did formerly, as to his first coming, and the setting up his Kingdom within; it being the power and sweetness of the later that naturally leads to the former: which persons must die, (yea, in the strength of the Lord will die) rather then they will part with one jot of that light they have received in the ear, and in darkness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.27. undiscovered to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to the work of their Generation, which is to be carried on in order to it: and therefore be sure you minde your Brethren.</p>
            <p>I have again made too long a digression: the Lord hath blasted the Courtiers design in the choice of that Parliament; for they did not establish their Protector: because of which, he hath dissolved them.</p>
            <p>But whilst they were sitting, the Protector, unsuitable to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and contrary to that tenderness he express'd in his Speech to the little Parliament should be had to the most mistaken Christian, who desired to lead a life in godliness, as in page 21. did suffer them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> to burn his Book, and were nigh passing the Sentence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168340:17"/> of Death upon him; which was a very unworthy and unjust thing, there being no warrant in the New Testament, which in these Gospel-dayes is most to be minded, for such a Practice; condering also the blood of the Saints, which hath been shed to free us from this bondage and persecution, and to purchase Liberty of Conscience for the People of God.</p>
            <p>Now had there not been something of self at the bottom, these things had not been suffered; but he was in good hopes, (all this while) in thus yielding to them, they would be encouraged to have yielded to him: but the Lord would not suffer the design to take: for the good which he would have had from them, as to the setting him up (which was evil) did not come by the evil which he did, in suffering him to be imprisoned.</p>
            <p>The aforesaid Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> (through the sollicitation of some of those Presbyterian Book-sellers, who set forth the Book called, <hi>The Beacon fired,</hi> in the time of the old Parliament, which tended very much to raise up a Spirit of persecution) is again imprisoned: which Persons, when we were carrying on the work in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> had not cared if we had been destroyed. Now that he should suffer this a second time, is, as I said before, very unsuitable to his former Principles and Practice: but in regard he hath taken up the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Beast, no wonder if he act suitable to the Spirit of the Beast; and surely the Knack and Mystery of this Iniquity, is to gain the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common-Councel, with the Presbyterians, sure to his Interest, thereby to strengthen himself, the better to persecute the dissenting Saints.</p>
            <p>But if I understand any thing of the minde of God, jugling, deceit, and dissembling of Principles, is not the way to win People and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for all those who shall come in to Christ and the Saints, who act upon his Foundation, and shall bow down before them, shall do it upon another account, such as is mentioned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.4, 6, 7, 12. <hi>He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor: he shall come down like rain upon the mowen grass, as showers that water the earth. In his dayes shall the righteous flourish,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth, the poor also, and him that hath no helper,</hi> &amp;c. And because of this glorious frame and love upon the heart as to these things; therefore, &amp;c. <hi>They shall fear thee as long as the Sun and Moon endureth, throughout all generations. They
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168340:18"/> that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust; yea, all kings shall fall down before him, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall serve him,</hi> as in the 5, 9, and 11 <hi>verses</hi> of that <hi>Psalm.</hi> This is a Prophecie of what glorious things shall be done, when our Lord Jesus shall, at his second coming, take to himself his great Power to raign in the World; which Prophecie hath its rise and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from what the Spirit of the Lord sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke by <hi>David,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3, 4. <hi>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds, as the tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain.</hi> When these comfortable words were by the Spirit hinted to, and spoken by <hi>David,</hi> doubtless he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that the Lord would certainly fulfil what he had promised, but he had also some taste, though a far off, of this glory which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was to be revealed; and therefore he breaks forth in a way of triumph and rejoycing, as in <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>Although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though <hi>Solomon</hi> who was of <hi>David</hi>'s House, and succeeded his Father upon the Throne, had a little touch of this Glory for a time upon his heart, and in his actions, as in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. which caused the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een of <hi>Sheba</hi> to admire him, and to bring Presents to him, saying, <hi>&amp;c. Blessed be the Lord thy God which delighteth in thee, to set thee upon the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee King, to do judgement and justice,</hi> &amp;c. Now this in <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a Type of the fuller Glory which should be in the time of Christ's second coming, and what respect should be shown to him upon the account of the love which will be upon his heart as to judgement and Justice. We may finde in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter, that <hi>Solomon</hi> so fell, by reason of strange Women which he loved, who as in the 4 <hi>verse</hi> of that 11 Chapter, turned away his heart after other Gods, for which the Lord was angry. Now though the Lord, did, notwithstanding for <hi>David</hi>'s sake, continue him upon the Throne for his life; yet he having turned aside from God, did lose that glorious frame which at first was upon his heart. Therefore these words thus spoken by <hi>David,</hi> was not meant of <hi>Solomon</hi> but of Jesus Christ, as this 72 <hi>Psalm</hi> before mentioned, doth from first to last
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168340:18"/> hold forth, as also the 89 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and more plainly in <hi>Isai.</hi> 32.1.</p>
            <p>And because of this Glory, which shall be in the dayes of Christ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting it self in the executing of justice and righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.15. <hi>Prayers shall be made for him continually, and dayly shall he be praised.</hi> And therefore do those Saints who believe that the Lord will make good what he hath promised to Jesus Christ, having also had by the Spirit some tastes of this glory already within themselves, when they are in the Spirit do they put up prayers to the Lord, and are in pangs for him.</p>
            <p>Now this glorious frame is in Jesus Christ, as he is God, and hath a fulness of the Spirit: and, as at his first coming to do and suffer the will of his Father, for the redemption of the Souls of his people, the Law of God, as to that work, was in heart; so in his second coming, the Law and Will of God, as to the executing of justice and righteousness, delivering the oppressed, and breaking of yokes, will be in his heart also, because it's the great and glorious work, which the Lord delights in, and hath appointed to be brought forth in the later dayes: which excellent and glorious frame, as it is in Christ, will by the Spirit being poured forth, be in the Saints also, <hi>Isai.</hi> 32.1. insomuch, that the greatest part of the Communion which they shall have with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>od in that day, will be from the suitableness and love which is in their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>And where this is, or the heart is purely by the Spirit breathing after it, from the sweetness it hath tasted in it, there will not be a sneaking, fawning fearful frame of Spirit, and a going down to <hi>Egypt</hi> for help to carry it on: There will be no running after the Rulers, Clergy, Lawyers, and a People that have been left behinde in former dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who have not light into, and cannot reach it: there will be no persecuting the Spirit of Christ (as at this day) and a going to destroy Antichrist abroad, and in the mean time uphold him at home: nor a using of that which is left behinde to suppress and keep down that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in those persons which are going on in the work of God that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>But in those dayes</hi> and where this glorious frame (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) is, <hi>shall the righteous flour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There will be no deceit, no equivocation, no lying, no jugling, but a continual waiting upon the Lord, and an approving the heart to him: and because of this, there will be such an eminent presence of God with, and a glory upon his people, as that all those who are not in the same enjoyment with them, shall be glad to come under their protection;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168340:19"/> and those who are enemies and will oppose, shall bow and fall before them.</p>
            <p>Those who taste the sweetness of, and are seeking after these things, will not own the Lord Major's Catch-poles, in their coming into the Saints meetings, to take notes, what they say, when they are speaking for Christ in opposition to the Spirit of the Beast and false Prophet, and to run away with it to their Masters, who through their dull under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, do usually make the Saints offenders for speaking sound and honest words; as to my knowledge one of the Lord Major's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or young men, did at a private Fast, which the Church to whom Mr. <hi>John Simpson</hi> is Pastor, did keep at <hi>Alhallows,</hi> the second of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> last: and being taken in the doing of it, he stood upon his terms with an impudent brazen face, and told us, <hi>He was come to carry our Minister,</hi> viz. (Mr. <hi>John Simpson) before the Lord Major.</hi> And many such Youths doth the Protector (so called) make use of for the like work at this day: now, if for him to suffer this, and to do these things, be not Apostacy and back-sliding, what is?</p>
            <p>There will be no doing of things so unsuitable to former honest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices, as the Protector doth in this day; as among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, that at <hi>Bishop's-gate London,</hi> in joyning with a few Malignants, Neuters, and Presbyterians, to put in a young Man, one Mr. <hi>Lec,</hi> a Minister, who derives his Ministery thorow the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as in page 15. of his Speech to the little Parliament, he sayes the Ministery of <hi>England</hi> doth; and in sending an Order under his Hand, to Mr. <hi>John Simpson,</hi> forbidding him to teach there for the future; which is contrary to the desires of the godly people in the Parish, with others who are the greater number, and by whose means he was called thither at first: his doing of which, in my judgement, is very evil, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I consider, (it being also well known to thousands) that Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> hath formerly been, and still is, a true Friend to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Christ, the Saints, and Nation; and hath in all respects stood by, owned, and been assisting to it, in the greatest streights and difficulties; and hath his Ministery from the Spirit, (as many thousands can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and set their Seals to the Truth of having oftentimes been refresh'd by it) which the Protector in the foregoing Speech doth acknowledge is the true and right succession; yet for all this, can put the other in, who if he would be faithful to his Principles, he doth not approve of; and turns out Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> upon no other account, but because he is more refined in, and keeps close to that Virgin-Spirit and Principle, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168340:19"/> he and we had in the day of our streights, when the Lord so owned his People, and for his being no Friend to Monarchy; and counsels the Lord Major to send his Officers with Halberdiers to shut the doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, to keep him from speaking in that place.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> apprehending and judging, according to the light he received from the Lord, (having set some time apart to ask counsel from him, what to do in this matter) That he ought not to obey the Order, it coming upon so unworthy and wicked an account; but rather to preach the Gospel to the People, for which he was called thither, though it were in the Gallery: and coming thither the 29 of <hi>July</hi> last, being on the Lord's Day, most of the Doors being shut, till the new Minister was got into the Pulpit; the doors being opened, he went in with the people, and got into the Gallery, the Saints of several Churches getting about him to keep him safe: and before the other Minister could settle himself to open his mouth, he began with Prayer; and when he was sweetly and powerfully carried forth, the Marshals of the City, and Constables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Vermin fit for such work) came up with their Staves, and pushed at him; and had not the godly people by bearing upon them, kept them off, they would have forced him to give over: But the Spirit of our Lord Protector in his Saints, prevailing over the Spirit of the Beast in the Protector, the Lord Major and his Marshals, Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> went on, after he had done praying, speaking in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Spirit, and with power: and there being such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent measure of the Spirit of God and Glory upon Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> and the Saints at that time, and such a damp upon the adversary, it's an eminent hint and manifestation, that the Lord disapproves of those wicked actions in the Protector and his Brethren, and that in due time the Spirit of Christ in his Saints, shall overcome the Spirit of Antichrist in the Kings of the Earth and the Rulers, according to that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. And therefore Friends take courage, and keep your ground.</p>
            <p>I shall now speak a little as to the Government it self: the Protector, (so called) hath the Supream Legislative or Law-giving Power and Authority of the Commonwealth, residing in him, his Councel, and a Parliament, as in the first Article of the Government; which Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was put in as a fine thing to stop the mouthes of the People for a time: the thing is so plain, that it is no Treason to say so, it being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he hath also the exercise of the chief Magistracy, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168340:20"/> Administration of Government over the said Dominions, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof, vested in him, and a Councel of one and twenty joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, as in the second Article of the Instrument; which is directly contrary to the forementioned Acts of Parliament, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, not yet repealed, as also the many Declarations, Protestations, and Engagements of the Army, which have been sealed with so much blood.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all Magistracy and Honours in the three Nations, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him, and he hath a power of Pardons, and the benefit of all Forfeitures for the publick use, as the late King had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in the third Article of the Instrument; which is directly the old Monarchy, and the lately destroyed Kingship newly erected, and a healing the deadly wound which was given to that Beast and his Appurtenances, which is his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
            <p>Now as to that of his giving Honours, pray consider how unsuitable it is to his former Principles and Expressions, which he had in those dayes, when the Lord so owned him (for owning his Cause and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in the several Battles which were fought, and when he had so much the Prayers and love of the Saints. I am very confident, that if one should have told him in that day, that he would come to do such things as he now doth, he would have said, as <hi>Hazael,</hi> Is thy Servant a Dog? I hope the Lord will not so far leave me, as suffer me to turn such a perfidious wretch and Apostate; and would have gone neer to have beate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that man or woman that should have said so to him: which is evident (or he did make us believe so, at least) by former Expressions which he used in the dayes of his Virginity, before he turned to Idols. I shall onely mention two of them.</p>
            <p>First, He would often say in common discourse, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Work in the Army, (speaking concerning the Lords and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) <hi>That it would never be well in</hi> England, <hi>so long as one Lord was left; nor sayes he</hi> (speaking to the Earl of <hi>Manchester) till you my Lord of</hi> Manchester <hi>be called, Mr.</hi> Mountague.</p>
            <p>The other was at a Committee in a business where a Lawyer was pleading; and oftentimes mentioning several Lords, Knights, Squires, Gentlemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> himself being there at that time, was very much troubled that the business was like to go otherwise then he would have had it, and did declare openly among them, with much ardency and zeal in answer to the Lawyer, <hi>That as long as we had one Lord in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:168340:20"/>
               <hi>we should never have good dayes.</hi> Yet himself can be called, <hi>His Highness</hi> now; and can very comfortably, and with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence take it upon him; and doth, as in page 7 of his first Speech to the last (called) Parliament, say, <hi>&amp;c. That a Noble Man, a Gentleman, a Yoeman, that is a good Interest of the Nation, and a great one,</hi> &amp;c. and complains to them of those Members who were left behinde in the little Parliament (who were acted, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> more refined, by that Spirit and Principle, which he formerly profess'd to be of, being i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that day a Teacher and a Leader of them, (as you may perceive by his forementioned Speeches) to these very things he now condemns them for, and sayes, <hi>&amp;c. The Magistracy of this Nation, was it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most trampled under foot, under despite and contempt, by Men of levelling Principles? I beseech you, for the orders of men, and the ranks of men, did not that levelling Principle tend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of all to an equality,</hi> &amp;c? And so goes on, reproaching and reviling of them, and measuring their Corn by his own Bushel, as if they would have set up themselves, as he hath done; which is his drift and design to do in all his Speeches; that by making them odious, he might the better trample upon them, and keep them down: whenas they were not for the taking away of any Honours and Titles, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those, which the late King gave after he left the Parliament, and had raised a War in the Nation, (which the Protector himself was for as well as they;) which Honours were given purposely to engage those Persons to his Interest, thereby to strengthen him the better to oppose, and overcome the Parliament; which Honours may well be compared to those which himself gives now, which are given not so much for the worth and godliness of the persons, who so gape after them, but onely (as the late King did) to encourage and engage them to stand by him, thereby to strengthen and secure him in his apostacy and backsliding; and whilst he persecutes and imprisons the people of God, who cannot bow to him, nor receive his mark.</p>
            <p>And although he be now upon the strain of giving Honours, yet I apprehend, they coming in upon the (forementioned) account, it will be looked upon as too low and base a thing by men of sound and spiritual Principles, who set the Lord before them, and would approve their hearts to him, and desire to lay out themselves for the good of their Country, to be seeking after, or receiving of them; considering also, as given by a Person, who acts so unsuitable to his Principles, and hath so much condemned the thing in others.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:168340:21"/>
            <p>And in that there hath been but one of the Colonels and a Captain of the Army which hath as yet been under this new Creation; I would be in good hope there may be a tincture of that honest Spirit yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, which formerly they had, when it could not in the least have entred into their thoughts, that they should ever come to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, much less the givers and upholders of these Titles; and I hope that this is the reason, why they have kept off all this while: but if it be not, then that Colonel <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Captain <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> two Young men, that they should be Knighted, for that slight service, in helping to quell those simple Cavaliers, which lately rise in the <hi>West;</hi> and for the old Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, and Captains, who have done greater service, and have born the brunt of the day, to remain as they were, (who if they desire such Honours, have reason to take it ill) holds forth one of these two things:</p>
            <p>First, That the promoting and securing the Beast, and healing his deadly wound, in supporting the Protector, is better service, and more worthy honour, then that was, whenas they were destroying him in the late King. Or else,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That he onely makes use of his Kingly Prerogative of Knighting men, but as a Bait and Snare to catch Wood-cocks.</p>
            <p>But, as I said before, I would hope that the old Officers of the Army, have not so much lost their former honest Principle, as to receive these Titles, if they were offer'd to them; but if they do, I will be bold to declare thus much unto them, That from the very day they do so receive them, a greater blot and stain then at present is, will come upon them, and their former Names and Glory will more consume and wear away; for the Lord is consuming; yea, and he will consume those Honours, Titles, and Greatness of the World, which men, through their Apostacy, Corruption, and Darkness, are so ready to give and take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He hath power to impose upon, or to take from the people at his pleasure, as in the thirtieth Article of the Instrument; though in the Armies Declaration, <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. 1648. <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Nothing was to be imposed upon, or taken from the people, but by their Parliaments; and if any attempts be made otherwise, the people should not be bound thereby, but free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Supream Power and Trust of the Militia for two yeers and a half, in every three yeers, is establish'd in him and his Councel, (as in the sixth Article of his Government) whom by his Negative-voice, he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168340:21"/> may control at pleasure: which Negative-voice, was opposed in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the late King.</p>
            <p>And while a Parliament is sitting (such a one as it is, that will yield to sit under him) his Interest therein is paramount to theirs, and hath the command of such a Militia and Army, as the late King durst not claim; which Militia, may, in short time, by his or any others policy, that shall come after him, having all preferments and places of profit at his disposing, be made wholly Mercenary, (as the present Army in a great measure is, the Lord and his people can witness) and so may be made use of, to keep down and destroy (so far as in him lies) whatever is for the real good and welfare of the Nation, if his Light and Principle cannot reach it, and from thence do not approve of it.</p>
            <p>And by a Negative-voice he hath such power, that all Bills presented to him, if there be any thing in them contrary to the Government, as that he may, if he will, under a colour of right, prevent their passing into a Law, without his consent; and if any do pass into a Law without his consent, it must be by the Parliament's declaring against him: and what Parliament dare do so, when they are so poorly principled to sit under him?</p>
            <p>And when he hath all the power of the Nation, by his Engagement upon them, to become his Creatures and vassals to command at pleasure: which thing to me is the more clear, when I consider, that the Officers, who are to serve in the Militia in the several Counties of the Nation, must take the Engagement, to be true to the Government, before they are in Commission. And let him be never so Tyrannical over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hath such power vested in him by the Instrument of Government, as to his Negative-voice, (the opposing of which in the late King, cost so much blood) that no justice can be done upon him, except he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should assent to it; for it is so ordered, That the command of the Militia cannot be taken from him but by his own consent.</p>
            <p>The evil of which Absolute and Tyrannical Government, ye may see, and some do feel already; for whoever they are that do oppose him, though it cannot be denied, but that he hath betrayed the Cause and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Christ, and robbed the Saints of their Rights and Priviledges, and therefore being so oppress'd may speak; yet if they do speak, and bear their Testimony against these things, and him, for the doing of them; or if he apprehends they oppose him, he sends out his Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souldiers for them, and by force brings them before him, and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Engagements to them to subscribe; and if they will not promise and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168340:22"/> engage to sit still and do nothing in opposition to the Government, (which he hath unrighteously and treacherously taken upon him) which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements and promises they cannot in Conscience subscribe and make, except they betray the Cause of Christ &amp; the Nation, (as he hath done) and so become Traytors to God and their Country; they must, in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way be sent to Prison, contrary to those Laws of the Land, which are good, or without any reason given or declared why they are so used: which is so unworthy, unjust and inhumane a thing, as the Heathens, and open Enemies of Jesus Christ, would not be so unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to do, as appears by the words of <hi>Festus</hi> concerning <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 25.27. (sayes he there) <hi>For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not withal to signifie the crimes laid against him.</hi> And yet our Friends in Prison, <hi>viz.</hi> Major-General <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> and Quartermaster-General <hi>Courtney,</hi> Major-General <hi>Overton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Feake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. though they were never such Friends formerly (and are at present) to the Interest of Christ, the Saints, and welfare of the Nation, yet must lie there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing cause why, or seeing the face of any Accuser; but meerly his Arbitrary will and pleasure: and that it is so, it clearly holds forth to me, that they who thus imprison them, do manage a wicked and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cause, and do it from a wicked Principle, upon such poor and unworthy grounds and reasons as they are ashamed to bring them to Tryal, lest the world should know it, and cry shame upon them: if it were not thus, why do they not proceed to try them, and bring forth their Accusers? It's a notable demonstration, that when the Imprisoned do more desire to come to their Trial, then he, or they, that do imprison them, or their Accusers are willing to have them, that they who do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, are more guilty, and do more deserve to be imprisoned themselves, then they who are imprisoned by them.</p>
            <p>And if any who are satisfied in their Spirits to procure their enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, by a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> should endeavour the same, as the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Grooby</hi> hath endeavoured to do, they are like to speed no better, then he did; who is a person that from the beginning of the War to this day, hath been faithful to the true Priviledges and Liberties of the Nation; and, lay in prison at <hi>Windsor</hi>-Castle, almost to this day, they shewing yet no cause why; but onely of the fears and jealousies, which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Beast had of him, that he is no Friend to Monarchy, or the Brood of Antichrist, which now is up again: which is a very unworthy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168340:22"/> and unjust account to keep a man in prison for. Now he having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to sue out his Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which Writs do require, that cause be shewn why the party is imprisoned; and if any cause lawful was returned, then the party is to continue still in Prison; but if he be in Prison without cause, then no Commitment from what Power soever can or ought in Law or Reason to be binding, it being the cause onely for which a Prisoner is committed, that cutteth the Prisoner off from the benefit of a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and not the will, pleasure and power of those in power.</p>
            <p>Now the forementioned Lord hath endeavoured by due course of Law, to sue out his Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for his enlargement, there being no cause shewed why he was in prison; and having taken out four several Writs to that purpose, the Arbitrary will and power of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector (so called) and his Councel, doth so hinder, that the Law of the Land, by these <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s cannot have its due course, and so are rendered ineffectual; and he was kept in prison almost half a yeer (very much to his prejudice, being infirm as to health) &amp; could not be enlarged till he had given security, he would not rise in opposition to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: which action in them is arbitrary, and plainly a subversion of such Laws of the Nation, as are just and righteous, and which he is bound by his Instrument (though I have nothing to do with that) to maintain; for which, and the like things, the late King lost his Head, as also the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as appears in the first Article exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, <hi>viz. That the said Earl hath traytorously endeavoured to subvert the Fundamental Laws and Government of the Realms of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c. and in stead thereof to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, against Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And by giving advice by force of Arms, to compel the Peoples subjection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That he hath Trayterously assumed to himself Regal Power over the Lives, Liberties, Persons, Lands,</hi> &amp;c. And hath not the Protector (so called) at this day done the same? And in the further impeachment of the said Earl, as in Article the first, <hi>viz. The said Earl did exercise an unlawful power on the persons and estates, and did fine, punish, and imprison Sir</hi> Conyers Darcy, <hi>and Sir</hi> John Bouchier, <hi>with others, against Law, and in subversion of the same: and that this illegal power might be exercised, he counselled and procured directions, That no prohibition be granted at all, but in cases where the said counsel exceed the limits of the said instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168340:23"/> And if any Writ of</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>be granted, the party be not discharged, till the party perform the Decree and Order of the said Councel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this was accounted Treason in that day. The Treason whereof lay in this:</p>
            <p>First, That he illegally punish'd and imprison'd the parties before mentioned, Sir <hi>Conyers Darcy,</hi> &amp;c. against the Laws of the Land, and in subversion of the same: the commission to do which he procured from the late King and his Councel, contrary to the Law.</p>
            <p>And, secondly, A further aggravation of his evil, was, That to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize the more over them, he procured further directions, in, and by the said instructions, by which they had further power to make new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Orders.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, Being so procured and made, they infringed and bounded the parties imprisoned, of that Liberty and Freedom which the Law of the Land, by a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> granted to them; and were to be kept in prison, till they had submitted, and yeilded to those illegal Decrees and Orders which were granted, and obtained contrary to the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>Now this, according to the Law of the Land, and the Judgement of Parliament, was Treason in that day; and is not the same, or worse, done now by the Protector, and his Councel, with the Army, uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in it? and those who are of the Counsel of, and do plead for the persons who are oppress'd and tyrannized over, do make themselves a prey, and are sent to prison upon no other account, but for their plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justly and righteously according to Law; and, because the things they plead for, do touch upon the Arbitrariness and Corruption of them in power.</p>
            <p>And because of this Tyranny and Oppression which was and is upon us, since this Government came in, the late Lord Chief Justice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Judge <hi>Rolls</hi> by Name, (a person that all along hath owned the Cause of God, and honest men, in opposition to the late King, and his party, (and others) who would oppress them) hath laid down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as unsatisfied to act any longer under this Power.</p>
            <p>And Sergeant <hi>Glynne,</hi> formerly Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> is made Lord Chief Justice in his stead, who is a person which the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> then General, and the Army, did charge and impeach of several Crimes, as being an Enemy to the Cause and People of God, being one of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven Members, who by the assistance of the Apprentices, and the old
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168340:23"/> Reformado-Officers and Souldiers, made the Speakers and Members of both Houses of Parliament, which owned the honest Interest, flee to the Army for shelter, and in the mean time chose another Speaker, and raised the City against the Army; there are eleven Articles exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, it will be too tedious to mention them; but this, he was an eminent Friend to the Malignants; and, that his Wife took an hundred pound as a gratuity for his service in the House, in getting three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds in consideration of the losses of some Grasiers in <hi>Wales.</hi> Now compare this with the Protector's Speech to the little Parliament, and see whether this be such a man of Principles and Godliness, as he so much there pretends they should be of, where Trust is to be committed: the Army charges him, I do not. But to be sure, for these things, he was imprison'd, and turn'd out of his Recorders place.</p>
            <p>Now if the Army and the new Courtiers, have good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That this man, who was then a <hi>Saul,</hi> be truely and indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Paul,</hi> and can say as of him, <hi>Acts</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.11. <hi>Behold, he prayes,</hi> and that upon true and spiritual Principles he be espoused to the good old Cause and People of God, which he formerly so much opposed; which if he be, I hope I shall rejoyce; but if he be not, it behoves them to consider what a sad condition they have brought themselves into, that honest men, who desire to set the Lord before them, and to approve their hearts to him, and who were their onely Friends in the day of their streights, do now disown (and turn off from) them, whereby they are necessitated to make use of such men, who were formerly cast out for their treachery and unfaithfulness.</p>
            <p>And that it is thus with them, it holds forth to me, that the Lord is eating upon them, and is consuming their Counsels; and that they are upon their last legs, <hi>viz.</hi> the strength, policy, and wisdom of man, with which they may bear up for a while, until the Lord doth further try and purge his People, and fit them for his work; but if one sound crack be given to their building, which the Lord, of himself, without the help of Man, can speedily bring upon them, they will so fall, as that they will never be able to rise, and bear up in these things which they are now in practice of nor build upon this foundation any more; and therefore they had need to look about them, and repent before it be too late. I have made too long a digression.</p>
            <p>And this was also counted Treason in that day, That the said Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> should say in a Court before the Justices and the People: <hi>That some of the Justices were all for Law; but they should finde,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168340:24"/> that the King's little Finger should be heavier then the loyns of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although the Man in Power doth not say, That his little Finger shall be heavier then the loyns of the Law, yet we may see by woeful experience, that he doth both over-top and over-power not onely the Law, but also the Law-makers, at his will and pleasure; in the doing of which, it appears, that his little Finger is not onely heavier then the loyns of the Law, but is also heavier in some things, then the loyns of the late King; who, though he was so rough at first, as to dissolve Parliaments, at his arbitrary will and pleasure; yet was so modest at last, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained thereto, from the necessity and reasonableness of it, that he tied his own hands from so doing for the future. And when Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bastwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> did not please him and his Bishops, they were brought to the Bar, and had a publick Tryal, though they had no justice, before they had their doom of Banishment. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector (so called) doth make no bones of it, to turn out Parliament after Parliament, and to pick and cull them as he pleases, and to send the People of God to Prison without seeing the face of an Accuser, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to their charge, or bringing them to a publick Tryal. And why should not this be Treason now, as well as then?</p>
            <p>The plain truth is, we are at his mercy, by reason of the power of the sword, which is over us, (which was never taken up on our part to this end,) and he may do with us what he pleases; and he doth so: if he will be good to us, and us use well, so: and its very likely if we will cry Grace, Grace, and fall down and worship his Government, (which is as to worship the beast) and will say as he says, and see with his eyes, and eat of his meat, and do as he doth, he will say we are good Boyes, and will use us well. But I pray Friends, in the mean time, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the eminent, wonderful, and glorious works (as the fruit and effect of faith and prayer,) which the Lord hath wrought among us; and of all the Saints and others blood which hath been shed, and treasure of the Nation which hath been expended, to purchase Liberty for us: that we must after all this, be so restrained and bound up under the Norman yoake again, as that all the good we are in the expectation of, and are breathing after, must be laid up so in the brest of one Man, and given out unto us, as he only in his wisdome and understanding shall judge meet: and if we will not have it there, we must goe without it? His doing of which, to me, is like the Man of sin, and Son of perdition, mention'd in 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>Who exalteth himself above all that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168340:24"/> is called God.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So that he as God sets himself in the Temple of God shewing himself that he is God;</hi> &amp; if he had his own will, would let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done in matters of Religion, and worship, but by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and approbation; which is clearly to Rob the Lord of his right, and the glory which is due unto him.</p>
            <p>So the Protector in taking to himself the Government of the Nation out of the hands of Christ, and the Saints, whose declared right it is, (not only in the Scriptures, but also by so many declarations and Engagements which have been sealed with so much blood) doth rob the Lord and his people of their right, and is a taking the Childrens bread from them. But as I said before, we are at his mercy: if he will be good, and use us well, so; if not, we must go through, and bear it as well as the Lord will helpe us, untill he lay us out a way to free and deliver our selves. For to me, and I speak according to my present light and judgment, and that which I believe (the Lord assisting) I can lay down my life for:</p>
            <p>I say, to me, we are no more to submit with freeness and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or to give the least consent or approbation that he should be, or do thus to us, then we are with freeness and cheerfulness to yeild to a thief which overcomes us, and takes away our purses on the high way; but rather oppose him.</p>
            <p>Oh friends! for the Lords sake rouse up your selves, and consider what is become of all the blood of the Saints, with others, that hath been shed; and treasure of the Nation, which hath been expended, to free us from this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> yoake and bondage, which now again is come upon us, and worse (in some things) then it was before. And if rightly considered, what man is there, though he be not godly, but onely endued with principles of nature, and morality, and hath the Spirit of a true and freeborn Englishman, would serve in Parliament, or in any Office civil or Military, pay Taxes to, or bear armes under, or in the least touch with, Countenance or own this Tyrannical wicked power, the Protector and his Counsel, who as a company of thieves are risen up, and have secretly broken in and forced themselves upon us, without our consent, so taking from, and robbing us of our rights &amp; priviledges? And that which further aggravates the evil of it, (as was hinted before) he comes into the power by the advice and contrivance of five or six, without the consent, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and prayers, yea, contrary to the desires of many of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both in, and out of the Army; who wept, prayed, fasted, appealed to the Lord, fought, bled, and were much in watchings in the behalfe of the cause and people of God, in the day of our straights; whose right it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168340:25"/> is, if any (yea more, to be sure) then the Magistrates, Clergy, and Lawyers, who cared not for us, nor the work we were about, and left us to shift for our selves, in the year 1648. (and care as little for us now,) to chuse their Rulers.</p>
            <p>And a further Aggravation of his evil is, he comes in treading upon the neckes of the Saints, our Friends, who were left behind, and afterwards turn'd out of the little Parliament. Who as himself (in the 18, 19, 22, 23 24 25. pages of his Fore-mentioned Speech to them, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-chamber) acknowledges were called of God: (says <hi>He) Truely God hath called you to this worke, By I think as wonderful providences, as ever past upon the Sons of men, in so short a time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it comes therefore to you by way of necessity, it comes to you by the way of the wise providence of God.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truly you are called by God to rule with him, and for him; and to be faithful to the Saints, who have been somewhat instrumental to your call,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>You own Christ by your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness in appearing here. God doth manifest this to be a day of the power of Christ, having through so much blood, and so much tryals as have been upon these Nations, made this to be one of the great issues thereof, To have a people called to the supreame Authority upon an avowed account: God hath owned his Son by this, and you by your willingness do own Jesus Christ: you are as like the forming of God as ever people were: you have been passive in coming hither,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thus God hath owned you in the face and eyes of the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Consider through what difficulties, through what strivings, through what blood you are come hither,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I say, you are called with a high call,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore know, you are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I say, never a people was formed for such purpose,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Own your call; it is marvellous, and is of God: you are called with a high call, and why should we be afaid to say or think that this may not be the door, to usher in things that God hath promised, and Prophesied of; and to set his people to wait for and expect?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we know who shall war with the Lambe against his enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they shall be a people called, chosen, and faithful,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truly God hath brought it into your hands, by his owning, and blessing, and calling out a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power; God hath perswaded their hearts to be instrumental in calling you; and this hath been set upon our hearts, and upon all the faithful in the Land: it may be it is not our duty to deliver it over to any other people,</hi> &amp;c. And who doubtless (as I may honestly say) sate there in answer to the faith &amp; prayers of those Saints, who had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168340:25"/> their garments, but desired to act up to, and to be more refined in, that Primitive Virgin-Spirit and principle, and those vowes, promises, protestations, declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to the Lord and his people in the day of our streights: and in turning out those Friends, and raising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up upon their ruines he doth keep down that Spirit and principle, which was and is (if any in the Nation) lively and active in that work of God, which in his speech he tells them they were called unto; a great part of which consists in the taking away whatever is oppressive, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and Babylonish in civils, and binding the conscience in Spirituals, as to the Institutions and appointments of men, which have no warrant or footing in the word of God; which if they had gone on to do, would have cut off and hindered him of that power, Pomp, and greatness of this world, which by present actions doth appear was his purpose and designe to bring to himself: which is like unto <hi>Herod,</hi> and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who in that day would have destroyed and kept down Christ, upon the same account.</p>
            <p>And therefore to me its very clear (for I bless the Lord, that by the help of his Spirit, I can and do see) that the great stress, and turn of the business now in controversie between the Protector (so called) and many of the Saints at this day, doth and will lye here, <hi>viz.</hi> in turning out those friends before mentioned: who were left behind in the little Parliament; and the disowning, persecuting, and imprisoning of that Spirit, by which they are acted: and the day is coming, (and not far off) when it will be asked, wherefore it was that they were turned out; and upon this very thing or point do I lay, yea the Lord layes, whatever men do think and say of it, the foundation of the work and cause, (as to men and means) which we are pressing after: for if they were more suited to the work of God, &amp; to the bringing forth those great and glorious things which (as in his Speech he says) are promised and prophesied of shall be brought forth in the latter dayes, and therein greater friends to the Interest and cause of Christ, the Saints, and welfare of the Nation, then they were who turned them out (as by their making them a Captain, and going down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the old forms, customes and maners of the Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it appears they were) then they are lighted, and have stumbled upon such a stone (that although at present it be but as <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, Zech.</hi> 4.7. never so small, weak, and contemptible) as shall be their downfal, let their Mountains be never so strong; and let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and imprison them never so much, they are such stones, as are laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> who though they are now in the dust, hidden and trampled
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168340:26"/> upon, yet the Lord will ere long, by the pouring out of his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, (which he hath begun to do already) make them appear, to the joy and rejoycing of their hearts; and all those who persecute and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison them shall be ashamed. And they shall be in the hand of Christ, as the <hi>Hail</hi> mentioned <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.2, 3. and the 17. vers. <hi>and as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying storm, which shall cast down to the earth with the hand, the Crown of pride,</hi> &amp;c. and shall sweep away the refuge of lyes, and the agreement with death and hell shall not be able to stand before them. And although the new Courtiers lay their Counsels and designes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so deep, and in the dark, to uphold themselves upon that Rotten and Antichristian foundation on which they stand, and have never so many Pastors, Members of Churches and Armies, joyning with, and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; it shall all be but as a broken Reed, and the Snow in Summer, it shall faile, and wast away, it shall not prosper: the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because our Lord loves righteousness, and will not, no nor cannot be faithful, if he should in the least own or approve of them, who esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish themselves by lyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22 13. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>And let them pretend never so highly for God, the good of Saints and the Nation, and do never such good things as to the matter of them, yet being built upon this foundation, all that they can, or do bring forth, will be before the Lord, but as the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which he will reprove, rather then have fellowship with.</p>
            <p>And having done thus wickedly, in taking the Government upon himself, suitable to it, he hath set up Tryers, at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as the Image to the Beast <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15. and as the Golden cup to the whore <hi>Rev,</hi> 17.4. as the high Commission-court, and that Trumpery, to the King; and as the Assembly to the Parliament; which are meerly the appointments of men, and have no warrant nor rule in the New-testament, which are chiefly to be minded, in things of such high concernment as this is.</p>
            <p>For where can we finde, that in a business wherein the eternal welfare of Souls is concern'd, That such a Mixture, or jumble of men, (as these Tryers are) were joyned together, and set up by the civil Magistrate, to try, examine, and so send forth such as should preach the Gospel? or where can we finde that a Church-member hath a rule or example to do any such thing, distinct from the Church? who is onely, especially in things of that nature, to judge and try that which is within, (with the rest of the Church) and not that which is without, especially, when not appointed thereunto by them? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. And how is it likely, that that which they would
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168340:26"/> have us believe they propound to themselves, as to the propagation of the Gospel by men so coming to them to be tried, (though indeed it is chiefly as a touch-stone to try who will or who will not submit to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as afterwards it will appear: I say, How is it probable, that the minde of God, the good of Souls, and their expectation should be served therein, by taking one man from <hi>London,</hi> another from <hi>York,</hi> another from <hi>Dover,</hi> another from <hi>Cornwal;</hi> so from <hi>Norwich, Cambridge, Plymouth,</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> scattering up and down in several places at so great a distance from one another? some of these, Lay-men, (so called) some, Ministers: some for the Baptism of Believers onely, some against it; some satisfied, others not, with the Foundation on which the Ministers they joyne with, stand; But do judge, They stand upon an Antichristian Foundation, as the Protector himself doth judge, the Ministery of <hi>England</hi> doth, as will appear in <hi>page</hi> 22. of his Speech made to the little Parliament: the words are thus, <hi>I speak not, it is far from my heart, for a ministery deriving it self through the Papacy, and pretending to that which is so much insisted upon to be succession. The true succession is through the Spirit, given in that measure that the Spirit is given, and that is a right succession.</hi> But it is to be doubted, that some of his Ministers that are his Tryers, and many others of the Ministery, who are past, and sent out by them, do very much lean unto, and have their dependance upon the other succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and not so much on that which is onely of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Ministers are as unsatisfied with their Principles and Practice, being some Presbyterians, some Independents, others Anabaptists, (as so called) of different Judgements; who if they did each of them act up to their several Principles, and did look at that more, then to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Favour, Fear, and Displeasure of Man, they would not do what they do.</p>
            <p>Besides, they are not inward with, neither do they know the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of each other, nor have they a competent understanding of the frame of the hearts or conversation of them who are sent up to them for their approbation; but onely by hearsay, and that (it's to be doubted) in too slight a manner; and being so, how is it possible they should be able to give a right judgement of things, which are so much for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and the good of mens Souls? by reason of which slight and overly doings, such persons get in, and are passed by them, who are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the true breathings of the Spirit in them who would follow the Lord where-ever he goes; and do not look upon nor own those who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168340:27"/> have it; neither are they willing, that upon occasion (when desired by others) that such should come into their Pulpits, especially if they are Trades-men, &amp; have not taken their Degrees at the University, though they are never so spiritual, gifted, and able to teach. I speak not at random, but of my own knowledge; which is an eminent manifestation to me, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are not of the right succession, which is of the Spirit: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these, I may confidently say, if not worse, are pass'd through their hands: which comes to pass, first, by reason of the unwarrantableness and unlawfulness of their Call, as by a power which is arbitrary and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped, having also no warrant or example for it in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And secondly they being so constituted, it is not possible they should come to a full and through understanding of persons, and things: which doth appear, if you consider the actions which proceed from that corrupt Spirit by which they act.</p>
            <p>For all those whose maintenance depends upon the State, though they are never so spirituall, gifted, and able to preach the Gospel, and never such Friends to the Saints, and ventured their lives with us in the time of the Wars, (and they know it well enough beforehand;) yet if they will not come to be tried by them, (which in conscience they cannot do) then that which was setled upon them, by way of encouragement and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, upon that account, must be taken away, though they have nothing else to live upon; and so their Wives and Families perish.</p>
            <p>But as for those who stretch their consciences to come and worship their Image, and close with their appointment, and do yield to be tried by them, though they are such as formerly had not cared if we had been all destroyed, (and, could we see their hearts, have the same frame still) yet if when they come, they can make a clever and pausible Answer, and Declarations, as to the things about which they are examined, they shall then have their Writing and Seal of Approbation, which is as the Mark of the Beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16, 17. by which they go forth, and have free liberty to buy, sell, and traffique with them; and without which, they cannot pass: and in their doing thus, they do discountenance and check the forementioned Friends to the Interest of Christ and the Saints, and leave them to be jeered, abused, and trampled upon, not onely by wicked men, but by many professors, who could not go along with us in former dispensations for want of Light, or slip'd their necks out of the collar, for want of Love, and left us to shift for our selves in the day of our troubles. Which plainly declares, that this new invention of the Triers, which as to their several mixtures, may well be compared to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168340:27"/> Image in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. is not so much for the understanding and knowledge of the fitness of persons to preach the Gospel, as it is to finde out who will or will not submit to the Government.</p>
            <p>And by their thus going back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as to the Government and its appurtenances, on purpose to keep down the Spirit of Christ, which would be lively and active in the work of God, (which hath been the constant practice of the Spirit of the Beast and false Prophet, against the true Spirit in every Generation,) they have brought themselves into the same predicament and condition, which the former Beast and his Bishops were in, who have been destroyed: for as it was said in that day, No King, no Bishop; and if no Bishop, no King: so it is now from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Whore, which remains in our day, sitting upon the Beast, though in outward appearance the Beast rules her. (The Truth is, both their Interests are so interwoven and mix'd together) that they not onely think, but begin to fear, That if there be no Protector or King, then no Tryers, Chancellors, Vice-Chancellors, Deans, Doctors, Masters of Colledges, and loose Clergy in the Nation; and if these fail, then no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; and so they wrap it up, and endeavour to strengthen themselves all they can. By which they declare, They have drunk of the Whores Cup, and have thereby received a tincture of the Spirit of the Man of sin and Mystery of Iniquity, which did formerly, and doth by them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent work; which the Lord is destroying by the breath of his mouth, and brightness of his coming, and which cannot stand long, let them use all the wayes and means they can to uphold themselves: for the Lord by his Spirit in his people hath lifted up his Standard against them, and they must come down.</p>
            <p>But I shall speak no further about the Tryers at this time, though much more might be spoken; onely I would add this further, as to what hath been said of the Chancellors, Vice-Chancellors, Deans, Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whatever it is, though never so eminent and glorious in the esteem of the men of the world, yea, and with professors, and many that are godly too; if the strength of the Spirit of the Beast, and false Prophet, and the old things &amp; ways which have been cast out &amp; destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must be taken up again, to uphold &amp; fence them from the Spirit of the Lord in the Non-conformists, who they fear will fall upon it, or else it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand; it's an eminent hint &amp; manifestation to me, That that which is so upheld, &amp; that which upholds it, will both fall, &amp; that without remedy.</p>
            <p>And the Scripture which I have, among others, to make good what I say in this, is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.23. from the 1 <hi>verse</hi> to the 21. the Lord
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168340:28"/> is making terrible work with the Inhabitants of the Earth, for sin; onely in 13, 14, 15, and the former part of the 16 <hi>verse,</hi> there are a little remnant, but as the shaking of an Olive-tree, and as the gleaning of Grapes when the Vintage is done, who at that time shall lift up their voice and sing for the Majesty of the Lord, and shall rejoyce in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, executed upon Apostates and treacherous dealers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you who are of the little Remnant, who are faithful to the Lord and his work in this day of Apostacy, be not discouraged, because ye are few; but blesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Lord, (for I will assure you there is great cause) that ye are of that number. In <hi>vers.</hi> 21. the Lord is dealing with and punishing of their Highnesses, the Kings and Great Ones of the Earth, shutting them up in Prison in order to further punishment. And in <hi>vers.</hi> 23. which is that I chiefly minde, when this is, <hi>Then the Moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed: when the Lord of Hosts shall raign in Mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and among his ancients gloriously.</hi> When these punishments shall be upon the world, it will be a glorious time, a day of joy and rejoycing with the people of God.</p>
            <p>Now although that Glory which shall then be revealed, will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine and surpass that of the Sun and Moon, which are the most glorious things in the world, that with our bodily eyes we yet behold; insomuch, as there will be no need of their shining, because the Glory of God and the Lambe, will be the Light thereof. <hi>Isai.</hi> 60.19. compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. and their being thus laid aside will cause shame and confusion to come upon them.</p>
            <p>So also, there will be such an abundance of the Spirit poured forth, according to that in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17, 18. and so much of the knowledge (and the enjoyment) of God, and such sweet and powerful refreshings (and experiences of his workings) in their hearts in whom it is, as they shall thereby be enabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And by this glory in pouring forth of the Spirit (shining so much beyond their expectations, as also beyond what they did receive from U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168340:28"/> and humane Learning) will that Sun and Moon in a great measure be (if not altogether) useless as to Gospel-work; whereby they come to be ashamed and confounded: and it will be well if they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape so too; And that there come not that judgement upon them for their hungering and thirsting after the riches and great things of this world, and for stirring up the Powers to persecute and imprison th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

I am very much out of the way, if some such thing as this be not nigh Mr. <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> the Metropolitan Tryer at White-hall, and some Masters of Colledges, and University-Diviners of this day.</p>
            <p>For my part, though I thus speak, I do honour Learning, and would be glad (if it were the will of God) that every one who hath the gifts and graces of the Spirit, had as much humane Learning, and more, then the ablest Doctors in the Universities; for it is an excellent thing, if taken in its due place. Yet I am very confident, that the so great expectations of the people from thence, as to the preaching of the Gospel, will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; and my Reason is, because the Lord is staining all that Glory, which men naturally are apt to put upon those things, which though they have some resemblance to (yet are on this side of) his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that light and knowledge which is onely and purely from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>And they have establish'd Tythes, which the Protector (so called) and the Army formerly judged to be Antichristian, as they did the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of <hi>England,</hi> as upon the Foundation on which they at present are; as will appear in his forementioned Speech to the little Parliament: and did say, That <hi>Tythes were also an unequal, troublesome, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious way of Ministers maintenance.</hi> And himself (as I am well informed) bid Mr. <hi>Jessy,</hi> and others, <hi>Call him Jugler, if they were not taken away by</hi> September 3. <hi>last.</hi> Yet he hath notwithstanding since this, ratified and confirmed a former Statute or Order, which is for compelling those who refuse to pay them, to pay treble damages; by reason of which, the Ministers (more then formerly) do come upon the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168340:29"/> Members of gathered Churches, and others, who live in their Parishes, for Tythes and maintenance, though they never hear them; and if they refuse to pay, (and so put into their mouths) they have power to bring them before the Magistrate, and to force them to it.</p>
            <p>Surely Friends, it's very unsuitable to this day, That such things as these should be suffered, considering the blood of the Saints which hath been shed to free us from this Tyranny and Oppression, and the many Declarations and Engagements, holding forth the Redress which should be given to these things, which do so much grate upon the Saints, and are such burthens to their Consciences; and that this Liberty should be given to those Ministers, who when we were in the work in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> &amp;c. prayed against us, and did all they could with safety to themselves, to oppose us, and had not cared if we had been destroyed, (as most of those Ministers did, who are so hungering and thirsting after Tythes) that they should after all this so hold up their heads, and have this encouragement from the Protector, to fall thus upon the true Friends to the Cause and Interest of Christ and the Saints: The consideration of it, would make any honest man's heart to ake; especially considering there is no warrant or example in the New Testament for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Ministers in that way, no nor in any other that is compulsatory or forced; but is left to be done freely, in obedience to the Command of God, from the reasonableness of it, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11, 14. <hi>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though it be a reasonable thing, and an Ordinance of God; that the true Ministers of the Gospel, who are made so by the gifts and Graces of the Spirit, (which is their call from him) should be Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, who receive benefit and advantage by the Spiritual things which they deliver; yet there is no rule or warrant, that the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and wicked sort of people, who have not received of their Spiritual things, (no nor for the Saints neither) should be forced by a Law to give unto them: neither do I think it in the least sutable to a true Minister of the Gospel, to make the maintenance of his body one great end, why he Preaches, and Communicates his spiritual things to the Souls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But rather, from that frame which <hi>Paul</hi> was carryed forth with, as in the 16 <hi>verse</hi> of the fore-going <hi>chapter,</hi> says He, <hi>though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me, yea woe is unto me if I preach not the Gospel.</hi> And why so? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168340:29"/> the Lord by Revelations, the gifts and Graces of his Spirit, did fit, call, and separate him to that work: And therefore it was his duty to be exercised in it; and not onely because it was his duty, but from the sweetness he tasted, in those Revelations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from the Communion which he had with the Lord in them, was he carryed forth with joy and cheerfulnes, to declare to others what he had received, that they might also be brought into the same enjoyment with him: and from this enjoyment, he had such a sweet and glorious frame upon his Spirit, as carryed him above the desire of their worldly things: there is a sweet Scripture sutable to this, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you; that ye also may have fellowship with us, and truely our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> vers. 4. <hi>And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be ful.</hi> They did not declare what they had received to make a Trade of, and to get money by it, as the Ministers of our days do: but from the powerfulness of that refreshment, which was upon their Spirits, from the Lords over-shaddowing them with his Spirit, that they could not contain it within themselves, but must declare it. Now where this enjoyment is, there is such a frame upon the Spirit, as leads out the heart to desire the Lord with earnestness, to dry up whatever it is, that would be going forth to worldly things; because the things of this world, are such clogs, as keep down the soul from these sweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments: and whoever they are, that are carryed forth co preach the Gospel upon this account; the things which they deliver shall be so sweet, and powerful, and shall so take upon the hearts of their hearers, that they shall not need to trouble and perplex themselves, and hale the people before Magistrates, and put them in Prison, for not putting into their mouths, for they cannot want; their work will be sure to bring wages with it, both from the Lord and men. When I consider the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Ministers in this day, it puts me in minde of two Scriptures, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5. and the 11 vers. in the 5 vers. <hi>Thus saith the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Prophets that make my people erre, that bite with their teeth, and cry peace; and he that putteth not in their mouthes, they prepare war against him:</hi> vers. 6. <hi>therefore night shall be upon you,</hi> &amp;c. there is the Lords dislike of it; and in vers. 11. <hi>the heads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of judge for reward, and the Priests thereof teach for hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for money: Yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us?</hi> And truly the Magistrates and Ministers of our dayes, may well be compared to these before
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168340:30"/> mentioned: the Ministers they teach for hire, and Divine for mony, and prepare war against them who put not in their mouthes: and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates they do the like; they cannot do justice, and judgement, without their fine Houses, and Faring deliciously, and Costly attendance, which is exceeding chargeable to the people: whereas if they were Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates from a right Spirit, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.15. they would abhor the thoughts of being so chargeable to the people: but as the Ministers whom they have strengthen'd, do fall upon the people for Tythes, so they themselves do fall upon them for Taxes, to uphold them in their Pride and Luxury: which Spirit in both of them declares they stand upon the Antichristian foundation, and have both suck'd in of the same Spirit: which things are very unsutable to the day and time we live in, and are contrary to former Declarations and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, made to the Lord and his people in the day of our streights, and which have produced very sad efects, as will appear, if we compare the present frame of Spirit, in the Souldiers, Saints, and the wicked of this and other Nations, to what they were, before this unrighteous Power came in; and the unworthy things which are done under it.</p>
            <p>For till the war was ended at <hi>Worcester,</hi> and since, untill our Friends in the little Parliament were turned out, (all which time, we were pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on according to our former Virgin-Spirit and principle, to more refinedness in things for the honour and glory of God, and to put them in such a way, as that one time after another, (according as the Lord did lead us) such as were most faithful to him, his work, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be called to Rule with him, over the Nation) there was an eminent presence of God, with the Army, and us, insomuch that our enemies both at home and abroad, as also the loose Clergy, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, did Fear and Tremble; and the Saints our Friends, (who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the light they had, were resolved to follow Christ wheresoever he goes) rejoyced: and if any who professed Religion were imprison'd, it was because they closed with loose persons, enemies and such as were left behind in former dispensations, who could or would not go along with God; and so would stop and hinder his glorious work, which in that day was going on.</p>
            <p>At which time we were getting more and more out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and the Saints both in and out of the Army, had a lively, cheerful, bold, couragious active Spirit, for God, his Work and People, and were not afraid to speak the Truth, and to be faithful to their Light and Principle they had received from him, whatever it cost them; as appears by these
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168340:30"/> ensuing passages, in an Apology of the Officers of several Regiments, <hi>April</hi> 28. 1648. where they say, <hi>&amp;c. When shall we see justice dispersed without partiality? or when shall the weal of the publick be singly sought after?</hi> And go on complaining, That <hi>such were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in</hi> Ireland <hi>and elsewhere who were cast out of the Army for their miscarriages, who deserve rather an ejection then employment.</hi> And do earneastly desire, and press, <hi>That such as were faithful, and were made use of in former services, might be imployed again.</hi> And do say, <hi>That he or they that did endeavour to put out the faithful ones, and did take in such as deserved not to be imployed, were such as have lately tasted of Soveraignty; and being lifted up beyond their ordinary Sphere of Servants, seek to become Masters, and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into Tyrants.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Man who is now in power, being then a Colonel or Lieutenant-General, and being concerned therein, could encourage and put them on in these things, himself being then brow-beaten by the Parliament, and suspended from his Command, (with some others of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) for no other cause, then his having such a Principle as he himself doth now persecute, and imprison Major-General <hi>Harrison,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for, at this day. But it's almost Treason now, for any who fear the Lord, to complain that such are again made use of, who in former dispensations were left behinde, and laid aside, and turned out, for their not doing the work which lay before them, as several in the last (called) Parliament were, and as some in the present Councel are, as also some that have lately been received into other Offices of high concernment: and yet there is hardly an honest Officer or Souldier to be found, that dares take notice (or open his mouth to complain) of it, though in the mean while their true Friends are imprisoned, and most barbarously and inhumanely used, as the Prisoners at <hi>Windsor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Feake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> were, and as Major-General <hi>Harrison,</hi> and Quartermaster-General <hi>Courtney</hi> are in the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> at this day; that a Servant-Maid was not suffered to go out and in, except she staid out altogether. And I pray what have they done, that they should be so basely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily dealt withal?</p>
            <p>And in a second Apology of theirs to the General and Officers since, (say they) <hi>We your Souldiers have served under your command with all readiness, to free this our Nation from all Tyranny and Oppression whatsoever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon this ground of hope, we have gone through all difficulties and dangers, that we might purchase to the people of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168340:31"/> this Land, with our selves, a plentiful crop and harvest of liberty and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you must understand, that these glorious words were spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got into the King's Houses, Palaces, Parks, Lands, Revenues, and Delinquents Estates; but having now gotten their Crop, they are at rest, let the people shift for theirs as well as they can: (they say) <hi>But instead of this, to the great grief and sadding of our hearts, We see that Oppression is as great as ever, if not greater, and that upon the cordial friends of the Parliament and us and to the just Rights and Liberties of the Nation; that they with us are slighted, abused, beaten, dragged to jayls; yea the best and most candid intentions of theirs and ours, are grossly and falsely misconstrued, even to such a heigth, as deserving no less then troublers of, and enemies to the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these words were occasioned by the Spirit of the Beast, which too much ruled in the Parliament, who would have sat down in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the things of that day; whence they did also take in and countenance a loose sort of people, Commanders and others, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the honest Sectarian Spirit and Principle; and those persons whom the Lord had owned and crowned with Victories, and were (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others) following him in his work he had then to do, and could not be satisfied (as they pretended at least) to sit down until they had done it, being also look'd upon as an erronious, dangerous, heady peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that would be satisfied with nothing; but would turn the World upside down, and bring all into confusion; and so would go beyond, and further, then what they had propounded to themselves to have sat down in; and apprehending, that if they did not go on with these Sectaries, they should come to be laid aside: Therefore did the Parliament (as I said before) endeavour all they could to keep them under, and that by closing with loose persons; just for all the world as the Protector (so called) doth now deal with Major-General <hi>Harrison,</hi> Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> &amp;c. who are acted by the very same Spirit and Principle, (though more refined) which himself was acted by and persecuted for in that day. And there is much more in this Apology to this purpose, which I omit. They go on complaining, (say they) <hi>Our condition is such, by reason of some who are now in power, that being oppress'd we may not cry,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which, they call upon the General and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, saying, <hi>Brave Commanders! the Lord put a Spirit of courage into your hearts, that you may stand fast in your integrity
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168340:31"/> that you have manifested to us your Souldiers. And we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that if any if you shall not, he shall be marked with a brand of infamy for ever, as a Traytor to his Country.</hi> Oh Friends, what a Gallant Spirit was here! these things could then be encouraged, and they who did them were clapt on the backes, and called good Boyes (by the man who is now in power, because himself was concerned therein;) but it's Treason now for any Souldier or others, to speak (or stir up one another) against that Tyrannical, oppressive, and Arbitrary power, which he who having tasted of Soveraignty, and from his being lifted up above the ordinary sphere of servants, hath usurped to himself over us.</p>
            <p>And all this time, till the little Parliament was broke up, this Spirit increasing in them, they could go to <hi>France, Spaine, Rome,</hi> or anywhere in the world, so they might carry on the work of God: let wives, estates, and their outward concernments go where they would, they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, having a call from God, to go on in his work, though never so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to flesh and blood. Surely the Lord was among them whil'st it was thus with them.</p>
            <p>But since this Man, by the wisdom and subtilty of the Serpent, hath taken Horns to himself, and is gone down into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and from that Spirit hath endeavour'd to put bounds to, and keep under what the Lord by his Spirit had wrought in the hearts of his people, to bring forth for him, in answer to Declarations, Engagements, Vowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to him and his people they would do, if the enemy were delivered into our hands, and doth brow-beat, persecute, and imprison the Saints, For cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon him to keep close to former Engagements and Declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And because they do not own him in his Arbitrary, and Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government, which without their consent he hath usurped over them, which is the onely thing for which they suffer at this day. Now since these wicked things have <hi>Jehu</hi>-like been done, this Primitive Virgin-glorious frame of Spirit, Boldness and Courage for God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is departed; and the greatest part of that people, both in and out of the Army, are with their Captain gone down to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and are turned into, and do close with those very things, (for the fear, favour, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this word) which had it been told them in that day, they would come to have yeelded to, would have said as <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Is thy servant a dog?</hi> and do lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e their brethren to be persecuted and imprisoned, and through Cowardize, and baseness of Spirit, and the fear of losing their Commands, Places, and the base inconsiderable
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168340:32"/> things of this world, they muzzle their Consciences, tye their tongues, and dare not speak a word for God, nor his despised cause and people, to any purpose: it may be now then one, or two, when their consciences gripe them, will come forth a little and shew themselves, but its like to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> who came to Christ by night: they will speak and do so, as to be sure they will save themselves; they dare not be seen, or heard by any who seek the Rulers favour, least they should tell him, and so they come to suffer for it, insomuch, that all they say or do, from this poor cowardly Spirit, is but like to a chip in Pottage, which doth more hurt then good.</p>
            <p>And truely there is such treachery, and baseness of Spirit at Court, in the Army, and among others that have any Relation to, or dependance upon them, as they dare not trust one another, nor know who to speak to with safety. And things being so, it is an eminent hint, and signe to me, that the powers which at present are, are not ordained, nor appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the good will, and pleasure of God; nor are their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done by his Spirit: for where the Spirit of the Lord bears Rule in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny person, or place, there is liberty, and boldness round about, a trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and a fearing the faces, or power of no man, nor things, when the honour and glory of God, and the good of his people, and the Nation is concerned; and the man who reproves within the gate, shall not make himself a prey.</p>
            <p>Now these poor creatures who are so cowardly, and fearful, and looke at the honour favour, and fear of man, more then the honour, favour and fear of God, (as their actions declare, they do) if they could see the Protector turn off from his Government to morrow, and those Friends, who are now persecuted, and imprison'd, set at liberty, and the things which they are pressing for brought forth, they would come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about them and be rejoycing over them, and saying to them, Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Friends, blessed be God that we are alive to see this day; and would be ready to leap out of their Skins for joy: the Lord knows, and they know it would be thus with many or most of them both in and out of the Army, they cannot deny it.</p>
            <p>But we may see what a pitiful sad Meakish Numb'd, besotted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition these poor creatures are in, and that for fear of losing a little of the honour, preferments, and unrighteous Mammon of this world; and though when spoken with, they cannot deny, but that the things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter of the Government, and manner of its coming in, with its appurtenances, is contrary to all Engagements, Declarations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168340:32"/> of the people of God, and therefore very abominable, and wicked, and do look upon the Tryers institution, to be a limbe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and not fit to be owned or suffered in this day; and that its abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably unrighteous, that the Saints should be imprison'd, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, for opposing these things: yet their Places, and Commands (as I said before) do sticke so close unto them, that rather then they will bear their Testimony, in reproving these unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they endeavour all they can, to quiet and stifle their consciences, in the mustring up, &amp; mis-applying such Scriptures, as <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. <hi>The prudent shall keep silent in that time, for it is an evil time;</hi> and think they carry it very wisely, if by the abuse of such places as this, they can pick out any thing to plead for (or colour over) what they do, (to help them to do which, the Man of sin, and Mystery of iniquity is very busie) though in the mean while they cannot deny but it is an evil time.</p>
            <p>The Lord Helpe these poor creatures by the powerful coming in of his Spirit upon them, for if ever any in the world denyed Jesus Christ before men, these people do; and doubtless, if they persist in this self-love, fearfulness, and baseness of Spirit, they will finde that the words of Christ in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven,</hi> are not spoken in vain.</p>
            <p>And I verily believe that all those godly men (who though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to the Salvation of their souls, be never so safe) that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived light from Christ, as to his work in their generation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to declare it, and bear Testimony to it to the very death, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.27. <hi>What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach on the house tops: and fear not them which kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. and yet upon fleshly considerations, do draw back, especially after such encouragements thereto, from that eminent presence of God, with them, who according to his will, have thus owned him, as that at one time or other, they shall be sure to finde he doth not approve of it, or take it well at their hands.</p>
            <p>And I will take the boldness to say thus much further, that all those who leave their brethren, (which cannot but speak the things they have seen and heard) to be persecuted and imprisoned, and instead of owning, and being a comfort to them, do not onely withdraw, but turn in with those Apostates, and Treacherous-dealers, who use them so unworthily,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168340:33"/> that such actions, are very unsutable to, and unbecoming, the true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, Members, and Spirit of Christ; who alwayes owned their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were following him in the Regeneration, and Tribulation, witnessing for him against whatever it was that did oppose him, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. to the 31, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.14, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.12, 13. &amp;c. And if our hearts be right and true indeed, we shall do so too.</p>
            <p>And do not wonder that any do suffer in this day in bearing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for Christ, in opposition to Antichrist, (though they who are the persecutors, shall not be excused) but rather rejoyce, because the Lord hath had formerly, and will yet have for the future, such a people in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very generation till he comes himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11. For Satan who is the great accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the Brethren, who by his power acts in the Kings, Protectors, and great ones of the world, to oppose, and cast the Saints into prison, is to be overcome by the blood of the Lamb, that hath purchased his Spirit, which brings that light and word into the Saints, according to <hi>Mat:</hi> 10.27. which they are to witness to, in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and not to love their lives unto the death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. And as the great Testimony which the Saints did bear in former days, and for which they suffered, was for preaching Salvation by Christ come, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.10.11, 12, and the things concerning his Kingdome within; though not excluding the other: So the great thing which they whil'st they suffer, shall suffer for in the future, shall be in bearing Testimony to, and pressing after the Kingdome of Christ without; and for opposing of that, which stands in the way, and this will be the onely erronious Opinion, that for the future will trouble <hi>Israel;</hi> and that people to be termed such as would turn the world up-side down: but whatever men think or say of, or do unto them, here they must live and die.</p>
            <p>And let them call that Spirit by which they are acted, a giddy, rash, Fanaticke devilish Spirit, which would bring all into confusion: the Lord knows it's his own Spirit, and the more they have of it, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed in communion with himself, and are redeemed from the earth, the more they will be alive in, and carried forth to the things for which they are so much condemned: let the Kings, the Heathens, the Priests and Rulers, rage never so much, and lay their heads together, to endeavour to keep them down, which they have begun in some measure to do already.</p>
            <p>For as the Rulers, the Captain of the Temple, and the Priests, fell upon <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and cast them into prison in that day, for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation by Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.1, 3, 10, 11, 12. so from the same
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168340:33"/> Spirit doth the Protector (so called) who is as the Captain of the Temple, and his Triers, and his University-Dean, and Doctors with his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in this day fall upon Mr. <hi>Feake,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> casting them into <hi>Windsor</hi>-Castle; and not onely so, but did set Centinels at their Chamber-doors to keep them from coming forth; which in effect is to tie their legs, and stop their mouths, thereby to hinder them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to others what the Lord hath revealed to them, and therefore must declare it, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. And as they deal with them, so do they use Major-General <hi>Harrison,</hi> taking him from <hi>Portland</hi>-Castle, where he had liberty to go about the Isle and preach the Gospel, and have coop'd him up in a Castle at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and set Centries upon him, and do so watch him, that as no Letter can come to him, nor Quartermaster-General <hi>Courtney,</hi> nor go from them, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Major <hi>Bull,</hi> who hath received his Horns and Power from the Beast his Master, and sees with his eyes, must pry into them; so also, that they may be hindred from preaching the Gospel, and the glory and excellency of the Kingdom of Christ; fearing, lest the People should be drawn away from the Protector and his Government, to follow Christ and his Government, which cannot agree and stand with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector's.</p>

There is that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presence of the Lord with them, that they never had before, which thousands beside my self can witness: which is an eminent hint to me, that they suffer for righteousness sake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye: for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.</hi> And knowing this to be so, I
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168340:34"/> judge it my duty, to give you warning, that you may more throughly search into things, before that, with the Protector (so called) and his Crew, you blaspheme the Spirit of the Lord in them, and others of the Saints.</p>
            <p>For whatever you think of it, there will ere long be such an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and glorious presence of God, by way of owning his despised little Remnant, who have received from him a little Faith and Strength, as whereby they are enabled to keep his Word and not to deny his Name, as is mentioned concerning the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Rev.</hi> 3.8, 9. In <hi>vers.</hi> 8. he speaks to them by way of commendation and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: <hi>I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it:</hi> (And why so?) <hi>for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing I would take notice of, is this: That there is such an open door to the Father through Christ for these faithful ones, to come and command him to give forth those things that concern his Glory and Kingdom within them and in the World, as none can shut and hinder them from it: therefore ply the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>A second thing, is this: The Lord takes notice and approves of that strengch and Faith he gives unto his people, though it be but a little; and therefore be not discouraged, though you have but a little, but bless his Name, for what you have: yet be not satisfied here, but be seeking after more, and let your end in that be, that the Lord alone may have the Glory.</p>
            <p>Now whilst these faithful Ones were by the Spirit of the Lord thus exercised, there was a people who made an high profession of godliness, and to be the people of God above others, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did look upon and judge themselves to be: and as many of the Pastors, and Members of gathered Churches do at this day. Well, these <hi>Jews,</hi> these religious people, were slighting, reproaching and blaspheming the Spirit by which those Saints were carried forth to be faithful to Christ, as some Pastors, and Members of Churches, with others, do, and are ashamed of and afraid to own that Spirit which the persecuted and imprisoned Remnant are acted by in this day. But ye shall see in <hi>vers.</hi> 9. what the Lord saith to his faithful Ones by way of encouragement to persevere and go on in their Light and Testimony, <hi>Behold</hi> (sayes he) <hi>I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but do lye; Behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</hi> So that the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168340:34"/> blaspheming, and imprisoning the Spirit in those Saints, as they did, or countenancing of it whilst it was done, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9, 10. was, notwithstanding their high profession, a notable discovery of the false Spirit belonging to the Synagogue of Satan, and which the Lord hath promised to discover when he appears to own his people; and a part of their punishment shall be, they shall fall down before the feet of them whom they blasphemed and persecuted, and shall be forced to confess they were deceived, and that of a truth the Lord is in and with them; and here will be punishment to some purpose in this very bowing to them, if there were nothing else,</p>
            <p>And therefore I advise you to take heed whoever you are, (though the form you are gotten into be never so high, and the profession you make be never so glorious) how you do slight, blaspheme, or are afraid to own, and do forsake the Saints, who are persecuted and imprisoned at this day, lest the Lord when he appears to own them (as surely he will) do make you (as the <hi>Jews</hi> to that people) come bowing before them: for I will be bold to say, that he is as eminently engaged as ever he was in any other thing or time in the world, to come forth in this day, and make it appear it is his Spirit by which they are acted, and his work that they are imployed in, and not their own or the Devils Spirit, or the setting up and advancing themselves.</p>
            <p>Now as the stifling the Consciences of so many professors by the riches and favour of this world, and the sneaking cowardly frame of Spirit, which is in the Army and elsewhere, and the persecuting and imprisoning the people of God since this Government came in, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Demonstration, that the glory of <hi>England,</hi> as to the primitive Spirit, is departed, and that the going down to <hi>Egypt</hi> produces evil fruits:</p>
            <p>So another evil effect and fruit which the taking up the Government hath produced, is it gives great occasion to the late King's party, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Gospel and the profession of it, because of the Courtiers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so contrary to former Protestations and Engagements: and truely they do so come upon us, as we know not almost how to look them in the face: for they tell us we are a company of Knaves, and Rogues, in cutting off their Masters head, and setting up the Protector: and do hit us in the teeth with it and say, <hi>Did not we tell you formerly (for all the promises and excuses you then made) that it would come to this at last?</hi> So that by the sin of a few a reproach doth fall upon the whole profession, and they do suffer who are not guilty.</p>
            <p>And as for our enemies abroad, it is well known that before this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168340:35"/> was set up, they did fear and tremble, and if any of the States Ships did bend towards the Coast of <hi>France</hi> at any time, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew down their men to the Sea-side, fearing lest we should have Landed: and they durst in that day, as well have eaten their own flesh, as have committed such a horrid Massacre, as they have lately done upon the Protestants, in the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> Country; or have done any thing in opposition to them, for they knew we were in a capacity, if it were desired, ready to help them: And in that there hath been and yet is such a freeness &amp; readiness in the people of God in this Nation, to help on with the Protestant-cause against Antichrist in other Nations, if invited thither by the Protestants there: and they through their rigidness, and Foolishness, refusing, from the prejudice they have of us, under the name of Sectaries, may be one Reason, why the Lord did suffer that blood to be shed in <hi>Savoy</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Government coming in so contrary to former Declarations, and Engagements, and the expectation of the Saints, and being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Virgin-Spirit and principle we formerly had when the Lord so owned, and shined upon us; and purely to set up mans interest, and to keep down the Spirit of Christ; it being so Notoriously wicked, and abominable, that those who understand things, and are deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, and desire to be faithful to former vowes and promises, can no more close with, or own it, then they can run their heads into the fire, or eat, and drink Poyson.</p>
            <p>Now the divisions of the people of God, being upon this account, and the glory which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rmerly was upon <hi>England</hi> being departed, which made the Nations begin to fear, and tremble; instead of doing so now, they speak reproachfully of us and count us, as a perfidious people: and as the off-scowring of all things; Because they hear a Protector is set up as King in the room of the late King, after we declared and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged so much against it: I am well informed of this from a sure hand, who was in <hi>France</hi> a little before, and since this Government was up. Now before it was set up, he said our Nation was Famous, and there was a very great glory upon us; But since this new thing came up, we were a reproach and scorn among them, and they did not esteem of us as formerly.</p>
            <p>We being thus divided, who should help carry on the Protestant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest abroad, whereby we are made uncapable of so doing, and they knowing it, are hereby encouraged, to take their opportunity, to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and to Murther the Protestants.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:168340:35"/>
            <p>But where this blood will lie, it behoves those who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Rulers, to consider: for to me its clear, that the Apostacy, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding, and the going down into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as to the Government, is that which hath encouraged, and strengthen'd the enemy, to shed this blood. And if so, then the work of them who were in a great measure the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it, had been in the first place to set a day a part, to Fast Mourn, and repent for, and so to turn off from the sin of Apostacy, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding, which was the cause, before they had kept a day to bewail and afflict themselves for the Judgement and affliction, which is the fruit and effect of sin: so that the weeping, Mourning, and afflicting the soul, under the sense of judgements and afflictions that are upon our selves or others, and in the mean time do not endeavour to put away the sin (if it be in us) which is the cause, then all that we shall do in this kinde, will be to the Lord but an abomination, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. And for any Governour or Governours, whatsoever he or they be, to set a Day or Days apart, to mourn, fast, and afflict him or themselves, for any loss sustained, or ruine and destruction that comes upon his or their brethren in other Countries, occasioned by the spirit of the Beast and False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and shall, in the mean time, retain in himself, or themselves, the same spirit, and from thence go forth to blaspheme, persecute, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that very Spirit, (and more refined for the work of God) as is in them whom he seems so much to be afflicted for, (as surely he doth, in his friends at home, at this day) both things are alike an abomination to the Lord: so that the Fast proclaimed by the Rulers, at his or their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, who are ready to do in every age and time, as the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, who hath power in his hand, (though it be right or wrong) would have them; yet this Fasting, as to himself, and those with him, is as little acceptable with the Lord, as the Fast mentioned 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.8, 9. which the Elders and Nobles by <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s command, in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s name proclaimed in that day.</p>
            <p>And as to that which is charged upon us by some, That our not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the Government, is that which strengthens and encourages the Cavaliers at home, and hath occasioned the shedding this blood abroad; I dare take it upon my self to answer, in the name of all those who have their eyes in their heads, and are concerned herein, That what we do in not closing with, but rather in the opposing of it, is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Principles of Reason and Conscience enlightned, and rectified by the Spirit of the Lord; being also back'd, not onely by the Word, but by the foregoing Reasons, as also the Declarations, Acts of Parliament and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168340:36"/> Engagements <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with some other Reasons, which come up in the rear: and we do it not in the least, out of any selfish principle, or wilful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Powers: for we own the Powers that are of God, who are rightly called, and do serve that end for which they are called; such, who with <hi>Judah,</hi> rule with God, and are faithful with the Saints, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. which Rulers will not be chargeable to the Nation, and live in pomp and State, and imprison the Saints, (as the Rulers of this Nation do) but as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are a terrour to the evil workers, and a praise to the good; who love, and are willing to execute justice and righteousness, deliver the oppressed, and break yoaks, because the Lord loves it; and are carryed forth thereto by his Spirit: and these are the Rulers which we are for, and may honestly be pressing after, and be unsatisfied till we have them; considering there hath been so much blood shed to make way for it. I say, What we do in all our strivings, contendings, and oppositions is not from any selfish principle, (the Lord knows it, we can appeal to him) but purely upon his account, and the real welfare of the Nation. And being thus grounded and satisfied in what we do, we dare no more (if the Lord uphold us) close with, or in the least own or countenance this Power, then we dare cast our selves upon swords points, or run into hell. And thus it will be with us more and more, (whatever men may think or say of us) if our understandings be enlightned, our eyes clear and single, and our hearts redeemed, or desiring to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the earth, and from among men, and are purely breathing after the Lord, and those glorious things which he hath promised, and are prophesied by his Spirit shall be brought forth in these later days.</p>
            <p>And as we cannot or dare not close with this Power, for the reasons afore mentioned; so we judge it very unsuitable, to joyn with any that may be sent by vertue of the Protectors Commission into <hi>Savoy,</hi> to fight with the enemie, who have Massacred the Protestants there &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by help to destroy Antichrist, and the Spirit of the beast, and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet abroad, and in the mean while to leave Antichrists foundation at home; (and the same Spirit, though more refined, behind us) persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that very Spirit (given in, in a higher measure;) which we in our going thither, do so much declare, we would relieve, and which the Lord will eminently use in the destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Antichrist, and their adherents: and therefore if any Saints should go abroad against Antichrist, before they see him down at home, the Lord may justly say unto them, Who hath required these things at your hands? it's unsuitable to an enlighten'd cleare-eyed Saint, to talke of throwing down Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168340:36"/> without him, if in the mean while he be not fighting against, and throwing of him down within him: as unsuitable is it to speak of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists throwing down in other Nations, if he be not first thrown down at home, in our own Nation, and so to carry on our work against him from a pure and cleare foundation, and from right grounds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; without which, let us go about it when we will, we shall make but very little of it, and shall be so low and Cowardly in our Spirits, as that rather then overcome, we shall turn our backs upon them as it's general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported the Protectors Army did upon a few inconsiderable cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers in <hi>Hispaniola:</hi> and no wonder, because whatever designe it is which is carried on to gain riches, thereby to advance and strengthen themselves, the better to keep down the Spirit of Christ, which (let them do what they can,) the Lord will make use of in the carrying on of his work; let their pretence be never so high for God, in drying up the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which they say is the Riches of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which now uphold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Pope and Antichrist, and the taking away of which, will be his downfal: yet they going forth upon this wretched principle, which is evident by their persecuting and imprisoning the Saints at home, and in sending persons to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y the work, out of the honest way which formerly went in, such as if they would be faithful to their light, for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deserve rather an ejection then imployment: all that they do upon this account, is but as the robbing of one who acts for Antichrist, to pay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which the Saints who have their eyes in their heads, do well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and therefore were by the Spirit of the Lord, drawn off from seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for their prosperity: &amp; if once the faith and prayers of those Sts who follow the Lord in the Regeneration be drawn off, and disingag'd from a person, or a people, which have formerly been the conquering weapons &amp; triumphing Chariots by which the enemy was overcome &amp; fled before us, no wonder if they flee before the enemy. And therefore my advice is to all whom this may concern, that as their aims &amp; ends, in what they do, are good; so also that they be sure the foundation on which they build, and the principle from whence it flowes, be good also.</p>
            <p>But some may object, and say, Are not we upon a good foundation? have not we the Liberty of our Consciences? insomuch, that every one may sit quietly in the enjoyment of Ordinances, serving the Lord under their several Forms, and there is none to make them afraid? and should not we have been glad, some yeers since, of such a mercy, as to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this Liberty? and is not this a great fruit of the Saints and others blood, which hath been shed in the purchasing of it? Nay, if we had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168340:37"/> nothing else, is not here enough? &amp; is not the Protector a good Man, and hath not he been very instrumental formerly for good to the Nation, and the people of God? and doth not he promise to be so for the future? All these things considered, we think we are upon a good Foundation.</p>
            <p>And such Objections and Reasonings as these, do many Members of Churches and others, (especially those, who have already and others who would have places and preferments under them) still and quiet their Consciences withal, in this day of Apostacy; whilst the very same Spirit with their own, if they would be faithful to their Light, and were not clouded in their understanding, from the love to wordly things, is persecuted and imprisoned.</p>
            <p>Now whereas they say, That the People of God have the Liberty of their Consciences, to serve him in their several Forms, and there is none to make them afraid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to that, I shall say, That there was as much Liberty in the time of the old Parliament, especially towards the later end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; yea, more then there is at this day: for there was no man, who was judged really godly, persecuted or imprisoned for his Opinion. And that Spirit and Principle, which is now reproached and imprisoned, was in a great measure owned; at least, there was such a glory upon it, as if any had had a minde, yet they did not dare to do any thing against it; which glory was from the Lord, as also from his people, pressing after a new Representative from the Protector (so called) and the Army; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though feigned, incouraging them at <hi>Alhallowes</hi> to go on in the very things, which they were then and are now upon saying, They were Fools if they did not: it being then looked upon, as no resisting of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, to plead and press for the Priviledges and welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though at other times, when he apprehended they would go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what would make for his Interest, he would be of another minde, and speak as much against them: and as he changed, so did the Army; which holds forth they are led by other mens light, and are not substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and clear in their Spirits and Principles, approving their hearts to God in what they do, which is sutable to that in <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe which receive honour one from another,</hi> &amp;c? that is, how can you trust in God, so as to do the things that onely are pleasing to him, if they oppose and clash with man's Interest, when you look not purely at him, but are seeking after the honour and respect which comes from men? their doing of which, if they continue in it, will be declared by the Spirit of the Lord blowing upon them, (which it hath begun to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168340:37"/> do already) that he doth not approve of it; and therefore they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to look about them, and to consider the encouragement which in <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.19. is laid down for a people to trust in God: <hi>O how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee, before the sons of men.</hi> Which trusting of God before the sons of men, is to look purely at the light they have received from him, and to follow him there, rather then to comply with men unsutable to their ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for their own advantages. From whence I gather, That as great good comes in by trusting of God; so on the other hand, all that seeming good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which comes in by pleasing of men, unsutable to the light we have received from God, will be but as Gall and Wormwood in the later end.</p>
            <p>And in the time of the Parliaments sitting, there was not a man that was persecuted or imprisoned for his Judgement or Opinion; nor was there an appearance or likelihood of any such thing for the future, as there hath been since this power came in, as in the forementioned Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> who was by the Protector's permission, thereby to please his Parliament, on purpose that they might please him, sent to prison, and his Book burn'd; his suffering of which, (as was said before) was very unsutable to his former Principles: which thing, with many others like it, the Lord will in due time, by one dispensation or other, call him to an account for, if he do not repent.</p>
            <p>Now I desire to be understood, That I am not of Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or do approve of what he holds, because, as I understand, he questions whether Christ and the Spirit be The God, or no: and if he be conscientious in this thing, and for the present can believe no other; I finde no Warrant in the New Testament to stop his mouth by Prisons, or beating it out of him with Clubs and Halberds; but rather by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments to the contrary, and to deal with him in that way, and not in the other.</p>
            <p>And if that Parliament (so called) had gone on sutable to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement which he gave them, which in a good measure they might have done, if they had pleased him in the establishing of him, what work would this have made among the godly? considering their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>But I pray you consider a little the working of the Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this particular: for in all the words thus spoken to them by way of encouragement to deal with erronious Persons, (as he termed them) those of the fifth Monarchy-Principle were chiefly aimed at, because,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168340:38"/> as he apprehended and feared, they above any other would have struck at his Glory and Greatness; and if they had fallen upon them, he would not have cared whether ever they had touched one of the other: nay, I dare be bold to say, that if it had not been for the fear of their opposing of him (as also by speaking something sutable to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, thereby to drill them on to his Interest) he would never have spoken about these things: for he knew they were not capable of their being committed to them. But in the mean time, we may see the good hand of providence, knocking and beating of his fingers in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and frustrating his expectations: for in stead of falling upon them, as he would have had them, they pass by, let them alone, and never meddle with them.</p>
            <p>Which thing to me hath a resemblance to <hi>Balak</hi>'s desiring <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in that day, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.11, 15, 16, 17. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.13, 27. and was from the same Spirit, though more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd. Now though they (I mean the last Parliament) had not a word from the Lord to let them alone, as <hi>Balaam</hi> had; yet considering their encouragement from the Protector, as also their Principle sutable and ready enough to such a work, and that the Lord should so over-rule as to spare them notwithstanding, it holds forth he hath a minde to bless them (as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.20.) &amp; that freely for his Name sake; and he doth not behold iniquity or perverseness in them, and will be with them, because the shout of King Jesus is among them; and for the glorious work he will carry on by that Spirit which he hath put within them. And what I shall &amp; might speak further in these things, I allude to <hi>Numb.</hi> 23, 24. ch. and if I know any thing of the minde of God, and the true breathings of his Spirit I may honestly do it. Surely, there is no Inchantment or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against that Spirit in them which was in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel;</hi> and therefore they may be encouraged to go on with boldness, according to the light they have received in the Work and Cause of God, though at present never so much persecuted and kept under; for this Spirit, Frame and Principle in them, shall not decrease but increase, insomuch, that it shall never be laid down till they eat of the prey, until all that which hath an appearance of <hi>Babylon</hi> and Antichrist, be thrown down: and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And do not wonder that I say the Courtiers are of that Spirit that must be thus opposed: for the work which the Lord is upon in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is a fine work: the contest with that which was more grosly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abominable, as in the days of the King, is laid aside in their being overcome; and we cannot but know there hath been something finer since which hath been overcome also, as the <hi>Scots</hi> and Presbyterians, who though many of them were really godly, yet standing in his way, &amp; hindering his work, he went on, though many of them did fall in it; and the Reason was, because they would have stayed, and rested in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and things of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and did not press on towards <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that Spirit which press'd towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> was the Lords Battel-ax, and weapon of war, by which they were overcome. And therefore be not troubled at what the new Courtiers and others say of your being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind this dispensation, as the Presbyterians have been formerly, and that the setting up Monarchy, and a Court, and the vanity which attends it, is higher then your light can reach too.</p>
            <p>Friends, keep your ground, and be not deceived, or led away by such reasonings and Speeches as these are; for it proceeds not from the Lords Spirit, but from the strength of natural abilities, which by the help of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168340:39"/> the Mystery of iniquity, is wound up to the utmost pin in them whom he would allure and entice to keep to themselves the Honor, Riches, and preferments of this world, though upon such terms, as doth many times grate upon their consciences, and without which reasonings and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, they could not but must cast away their silver and their gold, and the great things which they get in that way of Apostacy, to the Moles and to the Bats.</p>
            <p>I say, Friends, keep your ground: the work of the Lord, so far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any thing at this day is, to try principles, &amp; discover hearts; and is sifting with a finer sieve then ever; and the work he hath to do next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fine, high, and glorious work; he is by these discoverings and sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, taking the finest of all to go on in it; and the heart which loves the honour, glory, riches, and preferments of this world, and is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the earth, and from men, and is not chiefly satisfied in those refreshments which are in the enjoyment of God, shall never be able to go on in it: and therefore be earnest with the Lord, for his Spirit to do all that in and for you, which will fit you for his work; for if this frame be not in you, ye can never be free and cheereful in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of justice and righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but will be taking of Bribes and rewards for what you do, and will sit down with the next Kings or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors houses (those courts for owles) parkes, revenues and delinquents estates, as they have done before you, and so will stop the work of God in the next dispensation, as they have done in this, and so will necessitate the Lord, by his Spirit to raise up some others of his people, as his stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard against you; who will give you no rest, nor will not let you alone in your apostacy and backsliding, as by his Spirit in you he will not let them alone, nor be at rest in their Apostacy and backsliding of this day.</p>
            <p>There is one thing I would take notice of before I pass from this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: when Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> was formerly in Prison, there was some Pastors and several Members of Churches, as I said before, very much affected with, and spake against it, and wondred the Protector (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) would suffer such things; and some of them had gone to him about it, had not the Parliament (so called) been at that instant of time dissolved by him: and this they did intend to do, though they are not of his Judgement; but do look upon him as Erronious in what he holds.</p>
            <p>But as for Major-General <hi>Harrison,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> Colonel <hi>Rich,</hi> Quartermaster-General <hi>Courtney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Feake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> &amp;c. they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168340:39"/> may lie in prison for their witness to the kingdom and coming of Christ, and for bearing their testimony against the Apostacie and backsliding of this day, and for their pressing after and contending for those good things which are to be done in every day and time till himself comes, which have so long time been prayed for, promised, and expected, and have been purchased by the blood &amp; lives of their brethren, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would be glad and rejoyce might be brought forth; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, they are scarcely affected with it, but can go up and down, one after this thing, and another after the other thing, and regard no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the affliction of <hi>Joseph.</hi> To see how some carry it, even among the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized people as well as others, whom it concerns to look about them; you would think that in their judgements it did not concern them at all: and in the mean while can boast of their liberty, and the liberty which the people of God have.</p>
            <p>Now to me, when I really consider it, I wonder they can so boast of their liberty, when their fellow-members are in prison upon such a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous account as the pressing after those things before mention'd, which their hearts either do, (or should) breach after if they had light into them or were faithful to their light: surely whatever excuse they may make for themselves, this was not <hi>Pauls</hi> frame of Spirit, nor that frame which was in the Saints in the Primitive times: and that it is thus with them, it holds forth they do very little understand or taste the sweetness and glory of that Spirit, or the things which it goeth out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and which the Lord accounts of, and loves, above any other, <hi>viz.</hi> that spirit which follows him in his work, in every generation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28, 29. And truely I may say this further, whatever may be said to the contrary, (in the saying whereof I bear my Testimony to it, and therein give warning to those who slight it) That that Spirit which the Saints, both in and out of prison, are acted by in this day, (though it clash with the Government; which it cannot but do, if it be right and true indeed) is (setting aside infirmities) as really and purely the spirit of Christ, and the work they would have carryed on, his work, as ever any Spirit or Work which the Saints were acted by, or in, or did suffer for, in any generation from the beginning of the world to this day: and if so (as the Lord knows it is) then take heed how you carry your selves, that you do not slight it; but rather own it to the utmost: and I will assure you, that the more you do so upon a true account, the more comfort and sweetness you shall finde in it.</p>
            <p>Now as to that liberty we enjoy, which ye say, is worth all the blood
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168340:40"/> which hath been shed to purchase it, and that we are beholding to the Protector for it.</p>
            <p>I answer, That we do enjoy this liberty, I cannot but acknowldge it is a great mercy which the Lord is pleased to bestow upon us; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I do not give the least glory of it to the Man in power: nay, it were a shame for him, if it should be otherwise, considering it hath been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with so much of the Saints and others blood, as also that he in coming into this power, doth thrust out (and tread upon the necks of) those (I mean the little Parliament) in whose time there was more liberty then is, which cannot be denyed. Now for you who profess to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, what can you think of your selves when you argue thus, and boast in that which is less good, then that which was before? surely the Spirit of the Lord, as to the work within, will not let you be satisfied with less Grace, and the Image of Christ then you had before: neither could you boast if it were so with you: and if so, then what ground have you to rejoyce in this liberty, (I speak as to man,) which you now have, when it is less then that which was before? now I must deal plainly with you that if your hearts and understandings were right and clear indeed, you would no more be satisfied with that (which though it hath some good in it) which is given by a person who in the giving of it, hath put by a greater good, and so doth stand in the way of that which is better, then you can be satisfied with that little grace which the body of sin and death doth leave behind, when it hath hinder'd you of a greater measure which you had before.</p>
            <p>Neither do I think that the liberty we now enjoy, is all that which the Lord would have us to expect, as the fruit of that blood or in answer to those glorious prophecies and promises which are to be fulfill'd in the latter dayes: and truely to me, when they reason thus, it declares they do not taste the sweetness of that work of justice, and Righteousness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the oppressed, and breaking yoakes which is so much held forth in several Scriptures, the Lord doth love and delight in above all things in the world, and which Christ will do when he comes himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.1. and which the Saints by the pouring forth of the Spirit shall delight to do before his coming, and then too.</p>
            <p>And that such a Work as this is coming on, is clear to me, in that there hath been so much blood shed, in removing the Enemy out of the way, who were unjust and corrupt, and which hindred the carrying of it on; and which was chiefly, (though I do not deny the other) to make way that this Work of Justice, Judgement, and Righteousness,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168340:40"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be brought forth: and being very well satisfied it is so, we shall give the Lord nor Man no rest, till we see this Monarchical Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation down, and this Work in a greater forwardness, then yet it is, and that taken out of the way which lets and hinders. And I am sure, if our hearts be right with God indeed, and come once to taste the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which there is is those glimpses, which by the Spirit he conveys and reveals unto us in order to it, it will more and more be thus with us.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Friends, take heed that you sit not down in any thing on this side of it, or slight those persons who by the Spirit are carried forth to be pressing after it: if you do, you will suffer loss, and I cannot help it. For the Lord is not pleased that his people should only be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the quiet enjoyment of Ordinances, there is some other work which he hath for them to do; and the enjoyment of him in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is to fit them the better for it: and that he loves the executing of Justice, Judgement, and Righteousness, delivering the Oppressed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beyond our waiting upon him in Ordinances, among others I refer you to that in <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. from the 2 to the end of the 7 <hi>vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to that you say, That the Protector is a good Man, and hath been an Instrument of a great deal of good formerly; and that he hath been and yet is a friend to the people of God, and you believe will be so for the future:</p>
            <p>To that I answer, I do not deny, but he hath formerly been a good Man, and would willingly hope he will be so for the future, and that he hath been instrumental for good to the Nation and People of God: yet I must say thus much too, in that he hath been so instrumental for good, it was from his heart being stirred up and anoynted thereunto by the Lord; and therefore he may bless the Lord, that ever he did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him so far as to use him in the doing of any work for him especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if his heart were upright and sincere with him in the doing of it: but we must not, because he hath been an Instrument for good former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be therefore simply and weakly led away by that to follow him, or in the least own him in any evil which he doth, or accept of any good from him upon an unrighteous and wicked Foundation. It ist he duty of Saints, and it will be so with them, who are truely enlightned to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no Man nor Things, further then they follow or are for Christ.</p>
            <p>And you ought the rather to be the more circumspect and watchful, because in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. we finde that Satan transforms himself into an Angel of Light, by which he endeavours to carry on the work of his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168340:41"/> Kingdom the better; and we may truely say, He never did it more then now; for by his Wiles and Temptations, (the Lord for some ends best known to himself, suffering it to be so, that they should so consult with flesh and blood) he hath insnared some of them, who were formerly looked upon to be as Angels of Light, and eminent in the Work of God, to take up again, and live in the things that are the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients and supporters of his Kingdom, which were formerly destroyed. And I pray take notice of his Wiles in this; and because they have been so eminent formerly, therefore are so many Professors, Pastors, and Members of Churches, led away by them to wander after the Beast, especially those of them who have their dependance upon him, and have something of the world under him, which they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part withal: and truely, the baptized people are more to be condemned, then the rest, because in siding with the Court, they do own and countenance those very things, as to the pomp, pride and glory of the world, which they abhor and cast out among themselves; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one or two that are eminent among them, do follow the Court, and wander after the Beast, and a baptised Person is President of the Councel; therefore are so many led away to wonder with them. Whereas if they rightly understood things; and that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was taken up on purpose to put a stop to, and to keep down their Spirit and Principle, they would not do what they do.</p>
            <p>I say, We are to follow no Man nor Things further then they follow or are for Christ.</p>
            <p>Now that the Protector is Apostatized from the good old Cause of God, and is Adulterated from that Virgin-Spirit and Principle he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had, when the Lord so owned him, is so plain, as he that runs may read it; which things considered, we may nor ought no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any good he doth unto us, or approve him in it, then we may when a Thief hath robbed us, give our consent to be subject to him, or rejoyce in, and thank him for the Liberty he gives us, or think our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition good, he having robbed us of it before, and therefore hath no right to give it to us.</p>
            <p>I shall say thus much further, and I speak from my very heart, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also my present Light, I could as soon give my consent if the Lord enable me to bear up under it, to cut off my right hand, and to pluck out my right eye, as yeild to pay him Taxes, or in the least to own him in any thing which he commands, and that for the Reasons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:168340:41"/>
            <p>I know there may be Objections to this from such Scriptures, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6. to what I have given in as my judgement in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. For my part, I do not deny the paying of Taxes or Customes to help defray the Charge of the Government of the Nation: provided, The Governours or Rulers be such as are of the right stampe, furnish'd with the Spirit, and love to the Work which they are called unto, and do come in, (for they ought to do so in this day) by the Call and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the people of God, especially those who were most imployed in Fasting, Prayer, Watchings, Appeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in order to the carrying on the Work in the day of our streights, whose proper right it is to chuse their Rulers, and to take care what in them lies, that those good things may be performed which in their Prayers and Appeals they promised the Lord should be, if the Enemy were delivered into our hands: and the Rulers ought not to come in by stealth and under-hand dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their will, as the Protector (so called) hath done, as to his present Power and Title, and as by the Petition, which in an unworthy cheating manner is carried up and down both in City and Country, from House to House, yea, and into Prisons, to get Hands, by way of desiring him to take the Office and Stile of King upon him, and to settle it upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: which thing doth stink in the Nostrils of God and all good Men; and therefore my advice is to those to whom this Petition sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> come, that they tear it in pieces, as an accursed thing. For the Rulers of this Nation ought not to come in, in such a wicked way, treading upon the necks of the Saints, and building themselves up on their ruines.</p>
            <p>And whereas some do simply and weakly object from this fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the evil of their coming in, and themselves being unrighteous upon that account, <hi>That this is nothing, though they are never so wicked, we are to submit to them, because the Saints in that day were commanded to submit to</hi> Nero <hi>who was a wicked man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part as, to that, our Obedience to Rulers, commanded in the forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is onely as they are the Ordinance of God, which is to be a praise to the Good, and a Terrour to the Evil Workes; which is clear, if you look into the 3, 4, and 5 <hi>verses: For Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the evil: wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the minister of God to thee for good: but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the Minister of God, a Revenger to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> &amp;c. and Tribute was to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168340:42"/> paid unto them upon this account, as in <hi>verse</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Now is it likely that this can be meant of <hi>Nero,</hi> who was a wicked man, and a cruel wretch? could he, or any like him, be the Minister of God for good? Truely to me when I seriously consider those Scriptures it is very clear, that the owning of, and submission to Rulers is commanded purely as they are good, and as they have those qualifications in them, which suit them to that Work they are appointed to, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>I do not in the least encourage any to sin under evil Magistrates; but to walk so as becomes a People who fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Saints may be in such a place where wicked Rulers are, who hate the Spirit of Christ and Goodness; yet it is very unlikely, that the Spirit of the Lord in them, will lead them forth to pray for such Rulers, in a way of owning or approbation of them. I do not deny but that they may pray for their conversion, if the will of the Lord be so; but surely they cannot pray in a way of owning of them: the Church in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. from the 24 to the 31. when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> returned from the Rulers, did prac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>wayes: and the like to this, you will finde in other places in the New Testament, and so <hi>David,</hi> in several places of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> one in 139. 21. <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am I not grieved with them that rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them my enemies.</hi> So in <hi>Psal.</hi> 140.8, 9, 10, 11. And in <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.9. the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord in the Saints, calls him to awake: <hi>Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord: awake, as in the ancient dayes. in the generations of old? Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the Dragon,</hi> &amp;c? And so goes on in the next Verse: which to me is a clear hint, that the Spirit of the Lord in his People, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually be praying to him, against whatever it is that stands in his way, and hinders his work; and will be using of other weapons too, when they have a Call from him, and opportunity for it.</p>
            <p>And truely to me, to see Pastors and Members of Churches bring the Scriptures before mentioned in this day, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. to perswade others not to pray against, but willingly submit to the Protector and his government, is like unto the late Kings Chaplains and that party bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that place in <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.15. <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harme;</hi> applying it onely to the King, because some Kings were anointed of God to that Offices; thereby to hinder us from praying and fighting against him in that day: and the poor creatures thought they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168340:42"/> were in the right, as these do now: but I believe they will finde they are Mistaken.</p>
            <p>But suppose it were that wicked Rulers were to be owned, approved of, and submitted to by the Saints in that day, (as I do not apprehend they were) yet that dispensation and this which we are now under, is not alike, for then was the time of Christ's suffering: and if <hi>Peter</hi> would draw the sword (as he did in cutting off <hi>Malchus</hi> ear) Christ tells him he must perish by the sword, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.53, so 54. Suitable to this, you have another Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.2, 3. speaking of his suffering state: <hi>He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voyce to be heard in the street: a bruised reed shall he not break,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord had appointed it should be so: but if you look in <hi>v.</hi> 13 of this <hi>chap.</hi> you shall find him speaking as to his raigning time; <hi>The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up Jealousie like a man of war; he shall cry, yea roar; he shall prevail against his enemies:</hi> and so goes on in <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. The like to this you have in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. from the first to the last <hi>v.</hi> speaking of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing state: but in the last <hi>v.</hi> he speaks of his raigning state: <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoyle with the strong,</hi> &amp;c. The Saints in the primitive times were in a suffering state, and were not able to make resistance against the wicked powers among whom they dwelt: yet that doth not grant they were to submit to them willingly, and so own them as to approve of them; for doubtless if that had been the time for such a work and they had had a power in their hands to do it, they would no more have been pleased with, and yeilded to those Magistrates to have been over them, then we to have had the late King (who was less wicked then their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were) to have ruled over us, or any such for the future, who were like unto him.</p>
            <p>But now in our dayes, especially since thirteene or fourtene years last past, the Lord hath begun his Roaring work, and hath roared out of <hi>Zion,</hi> from and by his people: and the work they met withal, and were employed in, was to pray against, oppose, and cut off those wicked ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and powers, with their adherents which stood in his way, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the carrying on of his works and the appearances of God therein, &amp; his presence with his people, hath been so wonderful &amp; glorious, that we cannot but believe &amp; confess that he is coming forth to do his great and glorious works, which are so much prophesied of, and promised shall be brought forth in these latter dayes: and the Lord hath one time after another, been more refined in his dispensations, in his overturning
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168340:43"/> work, and hath by his Spirit in his people, still lifted up his Standard in every time against whatever it was which stood in his way, and had a purpose to destroy: which clearly hints to me, we are not to approve of, or bear with any thing in this day, which hath in it the least appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to stand in his way. Now if this power stands in the way of God, (as surely it doth) then we must not own, or touch with it in the least, but bear our Testimony against it: the which we do not do, if we yield to pay Taxes, or any other Contribution to them, or obey any of their commands: and this to me is the present Work that lies before us, as the opposing of Ship-money in the time of the King, till the Lord affords opportunities for a further Testimony: though the oppositions we meet withal in this, be never so terrible to flesh and blood, we must follow the Lord in it, and so reprove the unfruitful works of darkness, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then have the least fellowship with them.</p>

               <p>The colour and cloak which the Protector and his Party hath, and makes use of to cover this abominable Treachery, Apostacy, and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding withal, is, they pretend necessity for the doing of it, as if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents and Anabaptists were going together by the ears: and to hinder it, he sayes, <hi>He was necessitated to take upon him the work of a Constable, that he might keep the peace.</hi> Which is a meer fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for the Lord knows there was no likelihood of such a thing as their falling out: as also, that the Anabaptist-Spirit and Principle, was like to carry all in the little Parliament; whenas there was not above five (if so many) of them in the House; and that they would be throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down every thing, and building up nothing, and would in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bring the people about our ears.</p>

When the Lord knowes, that though he pretended to be of one heart, and soule with them whom he called into his assistance, yet he did not before, nor at that time, truly love, and owne that spirit, and principle, in them who pressed for righteousnesse, and true liberty, which was expected, to have been obtained, when the old Parliament had been dissolved. For it was said by some of the old Parliament, (who well knew what they said) to some, who at that time were instruments in helping him to do his work, that his heart was not right in that, which he so much then pretended to them, and that he onely made use of them, but as instruments, the better to carry on his own designe, and that he had some other thing in his ey, (<hi>viz.</hi> the setting up of himself) then they did imagine he had, and that he would d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

That the <hi>Protector</hi> and some with him had it in their eye, to preserve themselves in▪ and with an increase of that power, which they for so long time together had tasted the sweetnesse of, and therefore were now unwilling to part with all. And considering that the old Parliament would not answer that end, but would rather be a clipping their wings, they saw a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to lay them aside, as also they knew on the other hand, that those people who were highest for a new Representative, were so principled, as that they wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Surely though the King of feirce countenance and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing dark sentences, may through his pollicy cause craft to prosper in his hand, and thereby magnifie and strengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, against the prince of Princes, to persecute, imprison, and destroy the Saints for a time: Yet the same word which sayes, <hi>He shall do so,</hi> doth also say, <hi>That he shall be broken without hands:</hi> 8 Dan. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:168340:44"/>
               <p>And from hence it is, that he now turns in with the present Magistrates, Clergy and Lawyers, which would detain the people in the <hi>Norman</hi> yoak in Civils, and Antichristian bondage in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, which is very unsuitable to his former principles; and he doth this, not so much that he cares for them, but because he knows, that if he stand up for them; though they care as little for him, yet their interest being concerned, and most likely to be upheld therein, they will again stand up for him, and so will help to keep down those of the Fifth Monarchy principle, whom he onely fears. Just as the old Parliament took in and made use of the loose sort of Commanders, in that day, who were turned out of the Army, or deserved to be turned out, for their miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, thereby to keep down the now Protector (so called) who was then Lievt. General, and those of his Principle, who then joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him.</p>
               <p>And as the Presbyterians since, who cared not for the King, nor his posterity, no more than he or they did for them; yet did very much appear to stand for him, because in so doing, they judged it most likely to carry on their own designe, of settling Prebyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of curbing all others, who were not of their judgment; &amp; they apprehending that the <hi>Independents</hi> &amp; other Sectaries would oppose, rather than close with them in these things; therefore did they endeavour all they could to keep them down, and <hi>so went down to Aegypt,</hi> to close with the King and his Family, whom the Lord was destroying: the like to which the Protector (so called) doth at this day. And here is plainly the bottom and rise of this abomination, which is broken in upon us, whether we will or no. But let them go on, we have sufficient examples, and experiences before us, for our encouragement; from what the Lord hath done already, with those who close with Persons or Things, which either are not at all for God, or are lesse for him, than their brethren, thereby to strengthen themselves against those who were getting out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and were more for him and his work than themselves were: And I am fully assured, that as he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun already, so he will go on yet fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="4 letters">

For what ever they say and plead for themselves, the late King &amp; his Councel being taken away, there is no more need, as to the well government of the Nation; to have a Protector and his Councel in their room, which is the same and worse, (with his Court, pompe, vanity, building fine houses, planting Gardens, and making Rivers and Ponds, with the States money, for pleasure and delight, more then formerly, which cannot but be very chargeable to the people) then there is need to set up Bishops with their attendants, and to build up <hi>Pauls</hi> if it were down, for the advancement of Religion and the Gospel.</p>

               <p>But this I must also professe and declare, that it doth grieve my very heart to see so many under the several Forms, whom I dare not judge but are godly; both Pastors and Members of Churches <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be so drowned in security, and so forgetfull of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in, that glorious frame which once they had upon their hearts, for God his Work and People; and truly they appear to me, that instead of pressing on, and being more refined in it, and in being so ready to plead for, and to sit down with this present Power; (which they cannot but acknowledge, both in its rise and Foundation, on which it stands, as also in many actions which flows from it, is corrupt) and their so little minding their brethrens being in Prison, that they think the work of God in the Nation and in the World, is at an end, and will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but do not deceive your selves, is it likely (think you) that if the Lord would not have us having begun in the Spirit, to end in the Flesh; that he will do so himself: And therefore Friends instead of going back, I pray you be earnest with the Lord for his Spirit, to come sweetly and powerfull upon you, and so to refresh your hearts, in the enjoyment of himself, as that it may tend to redeem you from the earth: For til we are redeemed from the earth, and from the favour and praise of men, and our hearts in a great measure dried up to the things on this side God, that as there wil be but litle love to, (so we cannot be in pangs &amp; travail for) this glorious work which is coming forth. I do also declare, I have no enmity in my spirit, to the persons of those men, which in this that I write, I seem so much to oppose; I am only against those powers and things, which stand in the way of Christ, and hinder the carrying on of his work. And in that I speak so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in calling a Spade a Spade, &amp; as <hi>Nathan</hi> said to <hi>David, Thou art the man,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7.

But if I am not mistaken the dispensation over us will be such ere long, if the Lord doth not prevent, that we must either deal plainly and so suffer with our brethren, or else draw back with shame, for a slight owning of, (and testimony to) the truth, and cause of God, will not serve the turn, the Sts. are to overcome by the bloud of the Lamb, and word of their testimony, <hi>And they loved not their lives unto death Rev.</hi> 12.11. And although that according to the Lawes of the men of our dayes, which are like themselves, it may be construed, that part of the matter herein contained is Treason, yet comparing it with the Law of God, the Lawes of the land, and weighing things in the ballance of the Sactuary, there is nothing but what (if they would come to the touch, and give faire play) will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be truth; and such truth as ought to be witnessed to and notwithstanding that they (who are concerned herein) have the longest sword, and may wait their oppertunity to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; yet the assertor hereof, (who is not affraid, but if it had otherwise been convenient would have set his name to it) is so well satisfied, in the truth of what is laid down, as that he is very willing (let them come when they wil) to bear the brunt of what ever the Lord shall suffer them to bring upon him, and had rather suffer, and dye (he will boast in the Lord) for declaring what he understands, and knowes, as to persons and things which stand in the way of God, and do what in them lies to retard his work by which himselfe is (and many others are) dissatisfied, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as also to hinder others, from being led away with the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the wicked to their own destruction, then by his silence to sit down in peace, and safety in the greatest enjoyments of worldly things, with a gaulled Conscience, and thereby suffer the Lord to be dishonoured, his work retarded, and his people deceived. And therefore he having in the strength of the Lord, trusted him in the doing of his duty, in declaring these things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if you are really convinced of (and satisfied in) the truth of them, then be faithfull to your light, and have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship <hi>with the unfruitfull works of darknesse, but as you have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity reprove them.</hi> And know thus much; it is a shame, that we who live in this day, who professe to have a higher measure of light, then the Martyrs of old had, who in faithfulnesse to their light, loved not their lives unto death, that we should be afraid
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:168340:48"/> to venture a limbe' an estate (if we have any) yea a life, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witnesse to this glorious cause and light; for which the Saints are persecuted and imprisoned at this day; which is as glorious, and as much to be witnest to, as any light, or cause of God, which ever broke forth, and was witnessed too, from the beginning of the world to this day. When I really consider it, to me one of those poore Lether-coat Martyrs, that could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all that was neer and dear unto them, yea life it self, rather than act contrary to their light; was worth a thousand of the Professors of our days. Nay, I may say ten thousand, &amp; in that we have such great and strong heads, and so weak, faint, and little hearts: let us boast never so much, of the height and clearnesse of our light, and think never so highly of our selves: It is not so well with us as we do apprehend; and therefore it concerns us to consider whereabouts we are, and how it is with us. For if we are not more substantial, and zealous for God and his work now, then we were before; we must needs be worse than we were, and as it is said as to the work of Grace within: so may it as honestly be taken as to the work of God without us; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.38. <hi>That if any man draw back the Lord will have no pleasure in him.</hi>

               <p>It may not be long before your friend, who writes this to you may be discovered; and when he is so, there will not want some to be raking up, whatever may be gathered together, as to sins and sailings, to lay upon him (as it is the work and designe of the Devill in those who have cast the Saints into prison at this day) whereby to make his light and testimony against their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, invalid and contemptible; he will therefore before hand, (let them do what they please afterward) so farr grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, as to acknowledge, that he doth blesse the Lord, he hath been a sinner, and hath had his failings, and hath no righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in any kinde of his own: yet through grace, he doth hope and say, he hath righteousnes and grace in the Lord Jesus; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the Lord hath so wrought in his heart by his Spirit, as he would do no iniquity: But if it were possible (and it might be so much for his glory) would be as Jesus Christ was in the world; <hi>Hating sin and loving righteousnesse,</hi> Heb. 9. and would have nothing in him for Sathan to fasten a temptation upon, and would live continually (if it might be) in the enjoyment of God, wholly redeemed from the earth; and his heart and will swallowed up

And he having the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of these things within himself, he thinks it his duty to lay them before you, for your encouragement; and that you might rejoyce with him; if you have a taste of the same things within your selves as he hopes you have. He would also desire you, that the sence of your former iniquities and present failings; you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon your selves as standing in the righteousnesse of Christ, in which you are with out spot, before the father; he having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wrought within you, to be grieved, and burdend in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them; and a longing to be delivered from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin and death (and that from his spirit in you; which is contrary to it) <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. And in some measure a hungering and thirsting in your hearts, to the setting up the kingdome of Christ within you, as also without you in the world; which is a precious mercy, where ever the Lord hath wrought it: yea, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ten thousand worlds: As he would not have you be without a scence of sin; and the body of sin you bear about you, thereby to keep you humble, and to see a continuall need of the righteousnesse of Christ, to be clothed with; yet on the other hand, let not as aforesaid the Remembrance of former sins, and present failings; there being a striving against them, and a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hard after God; and a trouble we know him, &amp; love him, and obey him no more in the least cloud, damp, and discourage your hearts and spirits, and hinder you from a cheerfull and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious going on in the work of God; but go on in Faith, with courage, and boldnesse, in the grace, strength, and by the spirit of

               <p>And know this, for your further encouragement, that all those who are now Kings and Priests unto God, are made so: For they were sinners before, and that which brought them to this was not themselves; but is freely from the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, washing away their sins in the blood of Christ. 1 <hi>Rev:</hi> 5.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4 9, 10. <hi>And all those who stand before the Throne, and the Lambe, praising the Lord are such, as whose robes are made white in the blood of the Lambe; and therefore are they before the throne,</hi> Rev. 7.9.14, 15. And who ever it is, that over comes Sathan, the world, sin, and are faithfull to their light unto the death; Its all by vertue of the blood of the Lamb, which hath purchased, and redeemed them to this, freely through Grace. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 11: And none can sing &amp; learn the new song which the one hundred forty and four thousand sing before the throne, and can follow the Lambe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soever he goes, and are Virgins, pure and holy for the Lord: but such as are redeemed from the earth, and from among men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3, 4. So that it appears, that till they were redeemed, they loved (and were rooting in) the earth, and were living in the same excesse of ryot with other men, 1 Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were some of you, but you are washed,</hi> &amp;c. Its onely the redeemed ones, that get the victory over the Beast, over his Image, and over his Mark, <hi>&amp;c. And do stand upon the sea of Glasse, singing the song of Moses and the Lambe,</hi> Rev. 15. from 1. to 4. <hi>And they who with the Lambe do warre with, and overcome the beast are such as are called, chosen, and faithfull.</hi> Rev. 17.14.</p>
               <p>And lastly, For I shall name no more (though there be many) Its the redeemed of the Lord, who shall return and come with singing unto Sion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And all this is freely tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row grace: that so our boasting may be onely in the Lord; and that no flesh might glory in his presence. And the Lord help us willingly to give way that he might have his will in this; and that he alone may be exalted: And let us comfort one another in these things; and endeavour in a way of love to walk more closely with him; and to regard no iniquity in our hearts, words or actions for time to come: It must needs be thus with us, if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168340:49"/> we love the Lord and would have his presence. For this grace of God (if we have received it in truth and power, and have tasted the sweetnesse of it) doth not only engage us with a childe-like ingenious and evangelical frame upon our hearts, from the sence and apprehensions of it to do so; as <hi>Joseph, Gen.</hi> 39.9. and <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.5. and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2. and 12.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But also the spirit which through this grace we have received doth teach us, secretly working in us, as from an inward principle; leading and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling us in some measure to the doing of it. 2 Tit. 11.12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth salvation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Teacheth us that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and worldly lusts, we should live righteously, soberly, godly,</hi> &amp;c. So in Psalm 50.23. <hi>Whoso offereth praise, &amp;c. And to him that orders his conversation a right, will I shew the salvation of God.</hi> And this spirit, frame, and principle in us, are the materials, and substance of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Jerusalems building, &amp; of the stone cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without hands (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34.) that is without the wisdom, will, and power of man, but is purely through the Free-grace of God, and by his spirit; and which our Lord Jesus Christ will make use of to do his great works in the world; as to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his enemies before his comming, and to carry on the work of justice and righteousnesse; as also to rule with him when he is come. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.19, <hi>to</hi> 23. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.1.2. &amp;c. And till this frame be in us, and we have tasted the sweetnesse of it, we cannot be in pangs and travell, for Sions glory, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and kingdome of our Lord Jesus: And so of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must be left behind, and therefore as well as you can (for I do not deny the use of means, though its the Lord alone that blesseth them, and mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And as I said before, take heed that you give none of that glory which is only due to the Lord away from him, if you do he will not bear it; as we have had sufficient &amp; wofull experience in his withdrawings, when we have gloried in gifts, and enlargments, or in any thing on this side himself; and therein have thought too highly of our selves, which we are too ready to do, except he doth so over power us by his Spirit as to keep us from it: And as we have found the evill of it as to things within us; so also as to persons and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168340:50"/> things without us; as in his suffering the Protector (so called) (who was formerly so eminent and glorious in our eys and hearts; yea many times looking on him more then upon the Lord) to Apostatize and turn aside, to the frustrating of our too great expectations from him: so also in taking away our dear preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friend and brother, famous Mr. <hi>Tillinghaest,</hi> who (now he is gone) we may say in some respects; as <hi>Nichodemus</hi> said of Jesus Christ: John 3.2. He was a teacher that came from God; for he could never be able to speak with that power, glory, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, except God was with him; and had enabled him by the gifts and graces of the spirit, which he freely poured out upon him; and whereby he was enabled to administer such comfort and spirituall refr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Now the Lord help us to make a right use of this dispensation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to draw our hearts from the streams, to live in, and suck sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from the fountain. For if the spirit being poured out into an earthen vessel be so sweet and glorious, and communion with such a one so much to be desired, and our grief and trouble so great in the withdrawing and taking him away from us: purely upon that account, because of the spirit and presence of the Lord which was in and with him. Oh how should it stir us up to press after communion and fellowship with the Father and the Son; who have a fulnesse of the spirit; and can immediately (take up) our hearts into (and refresh us with) his presence, where is joy unspeakeable, and full of glory; and so far as I do understand, one great end of his being taken from us, is, that we may make this use of it, and that from thence, we may come to be more in pangs and travail, for Sions glory; and the Lord help us so to do.</p>
               <p>I shall onely say this one thing more, with which I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:168340:50"/> that if ye really judge, its well with your souls to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that you have a new heart and a new spirit, and are become new creatures; and that the Image of Christ be really, and indeed stamped upon you, and your hearts are also breathing, and panting after God, and that you have sweet enlargements and refreshments in your spirits in communion with him in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. I say, if it be thus with you indeed, then give none of the glory of this, to the wisdome, power, and will of man, as if ye had brought this to your selves, by your own improvements, of the naturall abilities, which he hath given you; but give the glory of it wholly to the Lord; who as he hath given you hearts to put forth your selves, to be in the use of means, in order to all this which is wrought within you, and done by you; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in that he hath accomplished the end; for which those means were used. But if you will do otherwise, and will put more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man, as to his own abilities, and puttings of himself forth, as to the use of means; and that for the doing of this, all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned shall be brought in to you; and so advance the creature above what is meet: and thereby take from the Lord what is due unto him; that spirit which leads to this, as also that spirit which sleights Ordinances, and is onely for a Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and sleights or denies that Christ without them, who died without the gates of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon a Crosse between two thieves <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.35, 38. Who is the first begotten from the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the earth, who hath loved us and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed us from our sins in his own blood. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. &amp; hath also bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed us in turning every one (whom he hath so washed) from our iniquities, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. who hath a fulnesse of grace, and of the spirit, out of whose fulnesse we receive grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19.
